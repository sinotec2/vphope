2.2 Licence Agreement
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO USER: THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND
CONDITIONS APPLY TO THE TRANSFER OF THE CadnaA
SOFTWARE. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETURN THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE UNOPENED AND SEALED - IF IT WAS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS STATED IN THIS LICENCE AGREEMENT. IN THIS CASE, ANY PAYMENTS WILL BE REIMBURSED.
L I C E N C E A G R E E M E N T
1. SUBJECT MATTER OF THE AGREEMENT: DataKustik GmbH
grants the customer a non-exclusive licence for the CadnaA software. The property right and the copyright in the software do not
pass to the customer. The licence is issued for use on one single
computer workstation. For any further computer workstation, a
separate licence agreement will be required. The customer is
responsible for the selection of the licensed software and its use.
2. HARDLOCK PROTECTION: The CadnaA software is hardlockprotected. This hardlock represents the value of the program. It
cannot be replaced free of charge, if lost.
3. PROHIBITON OF COPYING: Neither the licensed software, nor
the documentation, in whole or in parts, may be copied. The only
exception to this rule is the generation of a machine-readable
copy of the software for backup or archiving purposes. Any copy
made by the customer for these purposes shall be clearly
labelled like the original software, including the same complete
notices regarding confidentiality, property right and copyright of
DataKustik GmbH.
4. ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER: The assignment to third parties of rights and obligations arising out of this licence agreement, and the transfer of the software for use is subject to prior
written consent by DataKustik GmbH, Munich, Germany.
5. USE OF TRADEMARKS: The customer is permitted to use the

trademarks and commercial names used by DataKustik GmbH
to identify printouts, provided that (a) these printouts were produced by the licensed software using an electronic printing
medium, (b) these trademarks and commercial names are identified in the same way as done by DataKustik GmbH, and (c) the
customer stops using these trademarks and commercial names
upon termination of this licence agreement.
6. PROHIBITION OF MODIFICATION: The customer may not
modify the licensed software in any way, or have it modified by
third parties.
7. UNAUTHORISED USE: The customer undertakes to ensure
that his employees and any other person subject to the customer's instructions, having access to the licensed software,
comply with all obligations of safeguarding and the duty of care
and diligence arising out of this agreement. The customer furthermore undertakes to ensure that no person gains access to
the licensed software with the aim of deriving the source code. If
the customer becomes aware of any such persons as indicated
in the first sentence of this clause, using the software in violation
of the obligations of safeguarding and the duty of care and diligence mentioned, he shall immediately take any possible action
to prevent such use contrary to agreement. He shall inform
DataKustik GmbH in writing of any such use contrary to agreement, should it continue nonetheless.
8. INDEMNITY: DataKustik GmbH is entitled to the protection
rights and the copyright in the licensed software. The customer
can be held liable by DataKustik GmbH for any violation of such
protection rights which he is answerable for.
9. WARRANTY: The customer recognises that errors in the programs and the pertinent documentation cannot be excluded
given the state of the art. If, within 30 days from delivery to the
customer, the customer asserts any deviation of the programs
from the program specifications/description, he has the right to
return the defective software including the hardlock key to his

supplier, and to demand delivery of a new software version. If
remedial measures cannot be taken, or fail, the customer has
the right to demand cancellation of the agreement. In this case,
the customer shall destroy any and all copies that he may have
generated. In states where national legislation requires a term of
notice of defect of more than 30 days, that legally provided term
shall be taken to apply, if the software is purchased and used
there.
ANY FURTHER WARRANTY CLAIMS ARE EXPRESSLY
EXCLUDED. DataKustik GmbH NEITHER WARRANTS THAT THE
PROGRAM FEATURES SATISFY THE CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS NOR THAT THEY ARE COMPATIBLE IN THE SELECTION MADE BY THE CUSTOMER. ANY LIABILITY FOR LOST
PROFIT, FOR DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF SAVED DATA, AND
FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
IS ALSO EXCLUDED, UNLESS RESULTING FROM GROSSLY
NEGLIGENT OR WILFUL ACTION BY DataKustik GmbH. ANY
WARRANTY, LIABILITY OR INDEMNITY, ETC. PROMISED BY A
THIRD PARTY (E. G. A DEALER) TO BE GRANTED BY DataKustik GmbH IS NOT BINDING FOR DataKustik GmbH.
9. PROTECTION RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES: If the customer is
held liable by a third party because of an alleged violation of a
patent right, copyright, or any other protection right that said third
party may have in the licensed software, DataKustik GmbH shall
immediately be informed in writing of the alleged violation of protection rights, and DataKustik GmbH shall be supported sufficiently in any lawsuit. If the customer is held liable by a third
party in this way, DataKustik GmbH has the right to choose, at its
own discretion, to either provide the customer with the appropriate licence by the third party in question, to modify the licensed
software, to supply the customer with an equivalent different
software, or to take back the licensed software, in which case
the licence fees shall be fully reimbursed to the customer.
DataKustik GmbH is not liable for violations of protection rights

which are due to the fact that the customer altered or modified
the licensed software to suit his needs, or that the licensed software is used or sold in combination with other software, hardware or consumables not supplied by DataKustik GmbH. This
material liability is the total of any liability assumed by DataKustik GmbH for violations of any patent right, trademark right, copyright or other intangible property rights.
10. SOFTWARE UPDATES: DataKustik GmbH reserves the right to
supply to the customer the most recent version of the licensed
software. DataKustik GmbH reserves the right to charge the customer with additional licence fees for such updated versions,
and the customer has the right to decline acceptance of such
deliveries.
11. LEGAL INVALIDITY OF CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS:
Should single or several provisions of this agreement be or
become invalid, this shall not affect the effectiveness of the
remaining provisions of the agreement. The invalid provision(s)
will then have to be re-interpreted or supplemented in such a
way that the originally intended commercial purpose is lawfully
achieved.

3.2 CadnaA - the Software Program for
Noise Prediction
CadnaA for Windows is a program for noise prediction and efficent for
expert purposes.
The program calculates and predicts noise immission in the neighborhood
of
• trade enterprises and industrial plants
• sports and leisure facilities
traffic systems like
• road and railways
• airports and landing strip or
• any other noisy facilities
according to national and international standards and regulations.
CadnaA is suitable for noise protection as well as for detailed analyses for
mapping noise in large cities (additional XL option).
Extensive features like screen display, treatment and output of graphical
grids enable the usage of scanned plans (additional BMP option).
CadnaA automatically or semi-automatically promotes optimization and
allocation of the permissible area-related level of sound power for partial
areas of projected industry regions (addional BPL option).
The aircraft noise in the vicinity of airports according to the German regulations AzB (Instruction for calculation of aircraft noise zone) and general
landing strips and other aeronautics facilities is calculated with the additional option AzB.
A high priority is made of the import and export of existing data from
third-party programs like ArcView, MapInfo, DXF etc. or the import of
data from databases via the ODBC-interface.
The sound level during by-pass with time history and auralisation of moving sources, the different project-views like 3D-special as a photorealistic

Segmented Processing) to accelerate calculation of big projects, the groups
and project variants and result tables are only some highlights of CadnaA
- in your daily work with the program you will find much more and enjoy
it.
For quick access to CadnaA you will find a practical introduction in chapter „4.14 Quick start“ which gives you an overview for some important
features.

3.3 CadnaA’s additional options
CadnaA is a modular program system. This structure interlinks all possible program performances. The calculated, evaluated level in the vicinity
of an airport can be added and depicted to the evaluated level of a railway
and/or roads (prerequisites are the corresponding program options)
The basic program includes all features and types of calculation except the
following mentioned options. The basic program is a prerequisite for all
options.
Options only in connection with the basic program! Options 3.3
The option BMP imports bitmaps (e.g. BMP, PCX, TIF etc) with scanned BMP (Bitmap)
maps (ground plans, cadastral plans) or digital photos. Such bitmaps, when
loaded as background images in CadnaA, serve as templates for the definition of sources, receiver points, buildings and other objects. CadnaA is
capable of processing serveral bitmaps at a time (see Chapter 14 Pictures).
The option BPL is for the optimisation of the area-related levels of sound BPL
power for industrial areas. (see Chapter 8.15 Optimized Area Sources)
This option is an expert system to find the sound power spectra for many SET
noise sources like motors, gears, vans, ventilation systems, cooling towers
on the basis of given technical parameters. With CadnaA-SET you can
create modules with up to 10 input and 10 output channels for sound power spectra. You may define the creation of a sound power spectrum with
your own algorithms. If such a module is defined, it can be refered to all
sources in CadnaA. More than 100 predifined modules based on many
years experience and on many coupled output-inputs, so that even complex plants are simulated correctly in your project. (see Chapter 8.16 CadnaA-SET Option).
Option XL allows you to both calculate the noise by taking into account XL
about 16 million buildings in one run, and to perform calculations with

complete noise maps, and to evaluate a situation on the basis of given
noise levels and the number of persons living under the impact of these
levels. (see Chapter 11.6 CadnaA Option XL).
AzB Option AzB for the calculation of areas affected by air-traffic noise.

Selecting Standards for Calculation
Manual

3.4 Selecting Standards for Calculation
By selecting a desired country from the menu Calculation|Configuration|Tab Country the system will be adapted to the corresponding standards for calculation of industry, road and railways if the standards have
been implemented and purchased.
However, standards do not describe all possible situations or scenarios, so
that a logical interpretation of scopes has been made in many cases.
* We must point out that the program user is responsible for the professional use. We cannot take the liability for false calculation and its
consequences which are caused by inputs and system configuration.
The licence agreement, which is accessible also in the online help
with the same-named keyword, will be accepted with program use.
* Please also pay attention that not all data or values can be adapted
afterwards automatically according to the subsequently selected
standards if you switch the standards after the parameters of sources
have been entered. If necessary you must check and adapt the data
yourself.
If you e.g. choose first the German standards, input the train classes
to evaluate the emission level and afterwards switch e.g. to the
French standards you would produce a false emission level for the
French standard because in France you may not have the same train
classes and penalties.
The correct calculation will be proved with the „official“ available test Certificate 3.4.0
task. The „official test task“ is unambiguously defined test cases from authorized institutions.
For the time being the following proofs have been made:
• the „Test Tasks for the checking of calculation programs according to
the guidelines for Noise Abatement on Roads - Test 94“ by the Federal
Ministry for Traffic, Germany.
• the Draft of „Test Tasks for the checking of calculation programs

Hint for
Windows 95
* If, during the starting of CadnaA under Windows 95, the message
„OpenGL file not found“ should appear, this file has not yet been
installed with Windows 95 on your system. This file is essential to
the 3-D special view.
In this case, you can subsequently install this application by repeating
the Windows 95 SETUP, or copy it from the CadnaA CD-ROM. (We
supply the necessary data by way of precaution.) To copy the
OpenGL files from the CadnaA CD-ROM, use the following steps:
) Change to the drive where you inserted the CadnaA CD-ROM (e. g.,
D), and select its Support\Win95 folder.
) Copy the two DLL files from that folder to the c:\Windows\System
folder on your hard disk.
The problem should be eliminated.
Hints for
Windows NT and Windows 2000 or higher
When Windows NT, 2000 or higher is used, you must additionally install the Hardlock or Crypkey driver once as follows:
) Log in as administrator.
) Select the corresponding Start menu|Run
) Change to the drive where you inserted the CadnaA CD-ROM (e. g.,
D), and select its Support\Hardlock folder
) Run the HLDRV32.EXE file available in that folder. The Hardlock
driver is being installed.
) Afterwards, you can log off as administrator.
CadnaA has now been completely installed.

In CadnaA, selecting some menu items causes functions to be executed
immediately while selecting other menu items opens a dialog. When you
choose an item followed by ellipses (...), a dialog appears. A hotkey is often indicated next to a menu item. Using this hotkey allows you to access
the pertinent command without having to open the menu first.
By means of the identification letters (underlined letters), you can call Keyboard 4.9.0
CadnaA menu items from the keyboard as follows: Hold ALT KEY down,
type identification letter of the menu in question, release ALT KEY, and
then type only the identification letter of the desired command. If, for example, you wish to select the Save command, press ALT+F at the same
time (File menu opens), release both keys, and then type s for Save (document is saved).
But it is not only menu items that can be accessed from the keyboard. There are also some frequently used icons in the toolbox which can be activated by using a hotkey. To this end, hold down the Control (CTRL) key and
type the respective letter.

4.14 Quick start
To get familiar with the main basic function of CadnaA, we recommend
you work with the examples offered in this chapter. By doing so you will
insert your first objects by mouse, change their data and dimensions in the
graphic presentation, execute calculations and create noise maps among
other things.
Of course you have more possibilities to insert objects in CadnaA than
only by mouse, like
• digitizing from a plan with a usual digitizer with MS Windows interface
• input of the object coordinates via keyboard
• importing digital data using different formats e.g. for graphic files like
DXF, different GIS formats like AtlasGis, ArcView, Sicad, Windput
DGM and of course each CadnaA-file. You may also import data via
ODBC-database interfaces like MS-Access, MS-Excel, FoxPro etc. If
necessary ask for the actual interfaces.
Particularly for big projects these input possibilities minimize the expenditure considerably.
* You will find the example files on your CD-Rom in the directory
„Examples“. For comfortable working, copy them onto your hard
disc.
) Now start CadnaA by double-clicking the program icon on your
desktop or by clicking the corresponding start menu buttom|program|cadnaa if necessary. The CadnaA main window opens.

The open file Racingcours.cna
The file Racingcourse.cna contains some objects which are accessible in
CadnaA like roads, bridges, contour lines and points, embankments,
screens etc. We come back to it later. Now, see what performance your
computer has.
) With the RIGHT Mouse key click once on the middle axis of the road
or on the auxiliary polygon which is drawn over the road axis. As
shown in the following picture a context menu opens with a function

refering to this object „Road“.
In the edit mode if an object is marked with a Right mouse click a context menu opens with a
different function suitable to the marked object.
) Choose the function 3D (Special) by clicking the same-named command once.
Now it could be that you have to wait for some seconds till the 3D-special
window opens. How long it needs depends among other things on the dimension of the project file, on your RAM or on the quality of your graphic card. Your graphic card should have a 3D accelerator in any case.
Now you will find out exactly how it works.

) Press the RETURN-key - now you are driving through this szenario
with a speed of 100 km/h and a camera position 1 m above the road.
Is this not the case - you should „arm“ your computer so that you can take
advantage of the CadnaA’s powerful performance.
Incidentally - you do not need to wait until your trip stops. You may force Esc stops
that by pressing the RETURN-key. From the stopped position you may now

With this view you are able to check the correctness of your project modelling and see all objects with acoustic relevance which are taken into account for a calculation.
In the 3D-Special view you may also double-click on an object to open the
edit dialog for this object and if necessary to change its data.
Try and change a parameter in the edit dialog in the 3D-Special view like
the following example:
) Drive through the 3D-Special view - start with the RETURN-key and
stop pressing the ESC-key after passing the first bridge close to both
noise protection walls (barriers). If necessary use the arrow keys to
attain the right position.
As you may recognize the center of the left barrier seems to hang in
the air - there is no connection to the ground. Obviously this is an
error and has to be corrected.

) For that double-click on the left barrier - the edit dialog of the barrier
should open.

With it our exercises are finished and we hope we could ease your lead-in.
The training to operate CadnaA is minimal and you managed it already.
Although CadnaA is intended to be an easy-to-use program it nevertheless
is a precise and professional tool for noise abatement.
Whether you only need to give a brief acoustical expert opinion now and
then, or intend to check the noise propagation caused by your plant, or to
prepare colored noise maps for entire cities - you are already familiar with
many of the necessary steps of operation.

5.2 Files
In CadnaA all files have the extension CNA, which need not be entered
when saving a file, but is appended to the file name automatically. The import feature (see there) allows you to also insert your own Cadna-CNA
files.
Activating the New command on the File menu opens a new, "blank" file File|New 5.2
where you can enter objects. If a file has already been opened and edited,
but the modifications have not yet been saved, a safety check dialog appears which allows you to save the active file.

Save 5.2
When this command on the FILE menu is clicked, the currently active file
is saved (including any modifications) under its existing name. If the file
in question is new and has not been saved before, the "Save As" dialog
opens.
With the File|Save As command, the file in process can be assigned a Save As 5.2
name and then be saved under that name. If the new file name already exists, a safety check dialog appears allowing you to cancel the Save procedure.
Clicking Yes will overwrite the existing file. Clicking No cancels the Save
procedure in which case the active file must be saved under a different
name that does not yet exist.
Select the FILE|Exit command to exit CadnaA. If the active file has been Exit 5.2

5.3 Insert Objects
All graphical elements available on the CADNA A main window are called
objects. They can be inserted in different ways:
• using the mouse (see Chapter 5.3.1)
• from the keyboard (see Chapter 5.5.2
• via tables (see Chapter 15.2)
• by digitizing (see Chapter 7.2)
• by importing (see Chapter 6.2) and
• single objects also via the Windows clipboard (see Chapter 5.4.6).
When inserting objects, you can always use mouse, keyboard, and digitizer (if configured) simultaneously. You do not need to switch between those
modi.
To position an object, first activate the desired object icon on the toolbox
either by clicking it with the mouse or by pressing the respective hotkey
(see Chapter 4.8). Under the insertion mode, the icon just clicked then
sticks to the mouse cursor.
Now you can insert the object selected in the CadnaA main window either
by pressing the mouse button and/or pulling the mouse or via keyboard
when entering the coordinates. At the same time, this will generate a data
record on the pertinent object table (Tables menu).
Terminate
Insertion 5.3
An insertion procedure is terminated by either
• pressing the RIGHT mouse button, or
• pressing RETURN, or
• changing to a different object type by clicking the respective icon on
the toolbox or by pressing the pertinent hotkey, or
• changing to the Edit mode by clicking the respective icon or pressing
CTRL+E.

5.3.1 Inserting Objects Using the Mouse
There are 4 different ways of positioning or inserting objects using the
mouse, depending on which object or toolbox icon was selected. (see
Chapter 4.8).
Positioning Method 1:
Insertion of Points 5.3.1
(e. g. point source, receiver point, level box)
Position the object at the desired location on the CadnaA main window by
clicking with the left mouse button. Each click will insert one object in the
window, and generate the pertinent data record on the respective object table.
Positioning Method 2:
Polygons and Lines 5.3.1
(e. g. line sources, roads, railways, barriers, buildings, areas)
To insert lines or polygon lines and polygons, activate the respective icon,
then point to the desired starting point of the line or the desired first corner
of the polygon, and click. By this click, the first polygon point has been inserted. The mouse pointer now pulls a "rubber band" line from that point
to any location the mouse is moved to. Pressing the mouse button again
defines the second polygon point. Press the left mouse button at every
point where the polygon line changes its direction. Each of these clicks
will insert a further polygon point which can be edited or deleted afterwards.
As soon as the line or the polygon has the desired length or dimensions,
terminate the insertion procedure. In the case of polygons, the last point inserted is then connected to the starting point to give a closed polygon line.
Open or closed polygons may have arbitrary shapes. If you want to force a Right Angle
right angle press the SHIFT key while moving the mouse. In this case you
can only move rectangularly after a click.
* If you want to produce a closed rectangular polygon with a mouse
you should always start with the longer side and press the SHIFT key
during input.

With SHIFT key pressed down enter the first, second , third and if necessary further points in the usual manner by clicking the position
with the mouse cursor.
However do not click the last point on the final edge-point but on the
already entered first point. Therefore is the last point entered on the
right position and you may close the open polygon by clicking with
the RIGHT mouse button.
To produce rectangular layouts afterwards see chapter 5.7.5 Force Rectangle and chapter 5.7.6 Force Right Angles.
Positioning Method 3:
Text Boxes and Zoom +5.3.1
After activation of the respective icon, move the mouse pointer to that location where one corner of the box or rectangle is to be positioned. Press
the left mouse button and hold it depressed while moving the mouse in the
direction of the desired opposite corner. Release the mouse button when
the desired location has been reached.
Positioning Method 4:
Cylinder
The cylinder is defined by clicking two points. The first point defines the
radius centre, the second the radius length.

5.4 Editing graphic Objects
In the edit mode, you modify existing objects in the graphic representation
by editing their characteristic parameters, thus defining their properties,
positions, and shapes.
To this end, click the Edit Mode icon on the toolbox, or press CTRL+E.
Then select the object by clicking it with the mouse. The object is then
marked. All further commands will apply to the selected object only.
* In the menu Options|Miscellaneous you may choose the size of the
marker displayed by a marked object by selecting the pertinent value.
For all line-like objects entered as a series of points and objects limited by
lines, such as area sources, line sources, buildings, and barriers, you can
choose between two different edit modes: stretching mode (see Chapter
5.4.2) and polygon point mode (see Chapter 5.4.1). Clicking the Edit
Mode icon automatically activates the polygon point mode. Press the TAB
key to switch between the two modes under the edit mode.
Selecting
an object 5.4
To select an object, click its border, or, in the case of roads and railways,
its centreline, using the LEFT or RIGHT mouse button. Clicking with the
RIGHT mouse button at the same time opens a context menu offering you
further commands applicable to this object (see Chapter 5.7).
Double-clicking with the LEFT mouse button opens the pertinent object

5.4.5 Copying Objects
In CadnaA, you can copy objects within the graphics and into the Windows clipboard. Copying within the graphics refers to a selected object,
whereas to the clipboard, you may not only copy individual objects, but
also the entire graphics or limits, or Section thereof, all at once.
Copying within
the Graphics 5.4.5
Select the object to be copied. Then hold the mouse button down while
moving the object to the location where you wish to position the copy. Before releasing the mouse button, press CTRL. This generates a copy of the
selected object at the desired location.
At the same time, a further data record, with the transformed coordinates,
but otherwise unchanged data of the copied object, is inserted in the pertinent object list.
To generate a copy of an object and at the same time rotate it by 90° about
the vertical or horizontal axis, press and hold the CTRL+SHIFT keys during copying. This generates an object of the same size and parameters as
the existing object, with its centre at the same x or y coordinate as the copied object.

Copying to the
Clipboard 5.4.5
To copy objects to the clipboard, you can either
• click the pertinent icon on the icon bar, or
• select the Edit|Copy command, or
• press CTRL+C.
If objects have been copied to the Windows clipboard, you can paste them
in a different Windows application for further editing by selecting the Edit|Paste command, or, alternatively, by pressing CTRL+V.
Copying a
single Object 5.4.5
Select the desired object and execute one of the Copy commands.
Copying Sections 5.4.5 Use the Section icon (rectangle with broken lines) on the toolbox to define
a Section.
To this end, position the mouse pointer on the upper-left corner of the desired Section. Then, with the mouse button held down, drag the mouse to
the lower-right corner of the desired Section where you release the mouse
button. The area is marked by a rectangle.
Now switch to the Edit mode, select the rectangle and press, e. g.,
CTRL+C. The selected Section is thus copied to tSectionhe clipboard.
The rectangle marking the Section is neither copied nor printed, but only
the objects lying within the Section.
Copying Limits 5.4.5 To copy the entire graphics with the defined limits, execute one of the
Copy commands. During this procedure, none of the objects must be selected.

5.4.6 Inserting from the Clipboard
You may insert the contents of the Windows clipboard with Ctrl+V or with

it is a meta file.
The inserted clipboard contents will then be a Symbol object in CadnaA
(see Chapter 13.11.3) and also gets therefore its object options.
With it you are able to insert directly in your CadnaA graphics cross-section figures, 3D-special views or CadnaA tables quickly and easyly.
The inserted meta file from the clipboard may not be bigger then 1024 pixel. If that were so a frame with a cross inside appears. In that case you have
to use the CadnaA option BMP (see Chapter 14.2).

Press DEL to delete a selected object. The object will thus be deleted from
the CADNA A main window and also from the object table. If another object of the same type exists, this will be automatically selected after deletion of the previous one so that you could delete this one as well by
pressing the DEL key once again.
This method is particularly convenient for the deletion of a small number
of objects. The Delete command from the context menu (see Chapter 5.7)
has the same effect. Using this command also deletes the selected object
only.
If you wish to delete a large number of and/or different objects at once,
you can follow another convenient and quick procedure: the context menu
command Modify Objects Action Delete. (see Chapter 5.7.2)
The Edit|Undo command or the hotkey CTRL+Z allows you to retrieve the Undo 5.4.7
last 32 objects deleted. Just click the Undo (CTRL+Z) command as many
times as needed until the desired deleted object re-appears on your screen.
If you wish to retrieve a data record that was deleted from a row of a table,
first close the table before using the Undo command.
* Objects that were deleted via the context menu using the command
Modify Objects|Action Delete, cannot be retrieved using the Undo
command.

If an object is inserted graphically with its coordinates you must still enter
the necessary object data like, e.g., number of cars per day or hour on a
road, the speed, road surface or just the sound emission value for the
acoustical calculation. This is usualy done in the edit-dialog via the keyboard. But of cause you may also import this data from an external database via the ODBC interface (see Chapter 6.5).
To this end, to edit or to delete a object, first switch to the Edit Mode by
either clicking the pertinent icon or pressing the hotkey CTRL+E. Then in
the graphic representation, you can choose among three different methods
to open the edit dialog:
1. Insertion Mode (see Chapter 5.3):
) with the RIGHT mouse button click once on the object either on
the border (e.g. area source, buildings etc.) or on the centreline
(e.g. of a road, railway etc.)
2. Edit Mode (STRG+E):
) Double-click the borderline of the desired object (or the centreline, if the object is a road or railway), or
) position the mouse pointer on the border of the object in question. Clicking with the RIGHT mouse button opens a context
menu. Use the LEFT mouse button to click Edit.

First activate the desired object icon on the toolbox. You can now enter the
desired coordinates from the keyboard. As you enter the first number, the
dialog Input of Point opens.
Orthogonal Cartesian coordinates may be entered as x-and-y pairs, and polar coordinates as a pair of radius and angle. In the first case, which is the
default setting, the check box Polar is deactivated, in the latter it is activated.
The coordinates are entered either as absolute coordinates with respect to
the origin x/y = 0/0 (this being the default setting), or as relative coordinates with respect to the last point. In the first case, the check box is deactivated, in the latter it is activated.
When entering several points in a series, you can arbitrarily switch between the insertion modes using the mouse button, keyboard, and digitizer
on the one hand, and between orthogonal and polar, or absolute and relative coordinates on the other hand. The result of an entry can be seen upto-date at any time in the graphic representation.

5.5.3 The Dialog Boxes Name, ID, INFO
The boxes Name, ID, and the Info button are described below since they
appear on almost every edit dialog of an object. The other features will be
dealt with in the relevant chapters.
The Name box contains an object name which appears in the first column Name 5.5.3
of the object table. It may comprise several thousand characters. However,
since the column width is adapted to accommodate the longest character
string among the names, it is recommended you use short terms. One of
the possibilities for finding an object is to search for its name (see Chapter
5.6).
A character string of up to 15 characters entered in the ID box allows you ID 5.5.3
to group, identify, sort, activate or deactivate for a calculation or search for
objects according to different criteria.
Objects belonging to groups (see Chapter 18.2) can be activated and deactivated via these groups. Activated objects will be considered in the calculation. Deactivated objects will not be taken into account. The latter will
appear with dashed lines in the graphical representation (default setting).
(De)activation, ID, and grouping are powerful tools for the controlling of
projects and the handling of various project alternatives while using the
same data stock.
For each defined group you can present the proportionate sound pressure
level on the receiver points as partial sum level.
The check box next to ID allows you to specify 3 different activation
states for an object by clicking:
5.5.3 Chapter 5.5 Editing Objects
The Dialog Boxes Name, ID, INFO
Manual

5
If the check box is grey (default), the object is activated. This is the case
shown in the figure ("ID" written in black). The state can be manipulated
by grouping.
If "ID" is written in red, the object has been deactivated via a group and
will not be taken into account in the calculation.
If the box is checked (an x appears in the square), the object will always be
active no matter what group it may belong to and whether or not that
group, if any, is active. Therefore, "ID" will always be written in black.
If the check box is white, the object will always be inactive no matter what
group it may belong to and whether or not that group, if any, is active.
Therefore, "ID" will always be written in red. In the graphical representation, these objects will be drawn with dashed lines (default setting).
 Info-button 5.5.3 The Info button is available on every edit dialog of an object. When you
click it, a box opens where you can enter specific object information. The
contents of the info box is not printed. The box may contain up to 30,000
characters.
If the box contains any information, the button appears blue, otherwise
grey.

Decimals in Edit Boxes
Manual

5
5.5.4 Decimals in Edit Boxes
You may choose the decimal separator comma or point in the menu Options|Miscellaneous. The default is the point.
For all numbers with decimals entered in CadnaA, you will have to use the
active separating character. In many cases, the program is able to cope
with a comma or point, mistakenly entered as a separator by interpreting it
as the active separating character. However, this is not possible in all of the
boxes.
For example, in the edit polygon point dialog, but not in the table, you may
separate the decimals of the x, y and z coordinates of a polygon point, of
track centreline distance and slope by either a comma or point. In this case,
CadnaA is able to correct the separator point or the comma by taking it as
the chosen decimal separator.
In other boxes, however, which are used for performing calculation operations, decimals must be separated by a point. Otherwise, the value will be
misinterpreted or its acceptance refused.
If, for example, you enter 98,5 dB as value for LwA in the edit box of a
general source, this value will appear in red which means it is not acceptable. This box is a formula box where you can perform calculation operations such as arithmetic and energetic level additions, or even more
complex equations. In this box, the comma is a special character (max(1,2)
= 2). So here, you must use the point to separate decimals.
5.5.4 Chapter 5.5 Editing Objects
Decimals in Edit Boxes
Manual

5
Use the active decimal separator if you are editing in the object tables directly. Otherwise it could be that the values are not correctly interpreted.
* The correct interpretation of the decimal separator of CadnaA in
other Windows programs also depends, among other things, on the
country settings of the operating system.
It could happen, e.g., in MS Excel that values inserted from a
CadnaA table via the clipboard are interpreted as a date and not with
the correct number format. In this case you may have chosen the
comma as decimal separator in the system settings. To rectify the
false interpretation adjust the setting with a point for the decimal separator.

Line-shaped objects, such as line sources, roads, railways, contour lines,
etc. can be broken into separate sections. This splits an object into two objects with identical properties. Breaking down a line object is useful, if,
e. g., the parameters of the two sections are supposed to be different. You
can achieve this by using this command and editing the properties of the
new section.
The breaking of line-shaped objects is done by drawing a line with only a
start and end point which intersects the line-shaped object at the point
where it is to be broken. Such a line can be generated, e. g., by selecting
the auxiliary polygon, or any other line-like object, from the toolbox.
This railway is divided into 2 sections, for example, to
allocate a different type of track to one railway section.

Object types can be converted to other object types. For example, you can
convert a road to a railway, a contour line to a barrier, a building to foliage
or to a built-up area. Existing parameters are retained where this makes
sense.
In order to convert, e. g., the earler-mentioned parallel barriers along the
road to contour lines, select one barrier using the RIGHT mouse button to
open the context menu, and click the Convert to command.
A pop-up menu appears, listing all object types available. Click Contour

6.2 Importing
Data from third-party programs can be imported by CadnaA using various
file formats or via the ODBC interface (see chapter 6.5).
Any objects contained in the current Cadna file will not be deleted, but the
external file will be inserted or existing data will be updated. This enables
you to continuously complete a file by importing external and/or internal
data.
Depending on the file format, CadnaA allows you to specify certain im- Import Options 6.2
porting options:
• Selection of layers to be assigned to specified object types (see chapter Layer
6.3.1 "Allocate Object type to Layer").
Coordinate Transformation
• Coordinate transformation serving to match the data to those of your
project file (see chapter 6.3.4).
• Specification of a target area in your project file by using the Section Importing in a target area
tool, to where the data are to be imported in order to reduce the amount
of data (see chapter 6.3.2 "Importing in Section only").
Selection of Object
types 6.2
• Selection of object types - by this you may import only the needed
object types from a file, e.g., only roads.
Select the Import command from the File menu if you wish to make use File Formats 6.2
of a file format to insert objects from an external file in your project file
(file formats like, e. g., GIS like ArcView, MapInfo, CAD like AutoCad
DXF and other third-party programs).
In the file selection dialog, first select the File Format from the list box,
then select the file to be imported.
The button Options allows you to specify the import options depending on
the selected file format (see further below in this chapter).
The files are imported by clicking the OK button.

6.3 Import Options
After clicking the Options button on the Open File dialog, you can specify a desired coordinate transformation and, for some file formats like AtlasGis, DXF, and SICAD, enter information concerning layer IDs and the
limits.
CadnaA makes use of the geometrical object types: point, open and closed
lines (see Chapter 10 Topography). If any object to be imported does not
comply with the geometrical object types under CadnaA – like, e. g., an
open polygon being imported as an area source – it will always be interpreted as an auxiliary polygon, which means it will be irrelevant for the
acoustical calculations. In such a case, you would have to select the Convert to command from the context menu (see chapter 5.7) to convert the
auxiliary polygon to an object of the desired type.
* If you intend to import data from third-party programs, we recommend you ensure that the object types conform to the geometrical
object types under CadnaA.
CadnaA may interpret imported points as, e.g., point sources, height
points, crossing lights or tennis balls or imported lines as line sources, roads, railways or barriers etc.

layer as objects of the type allocated to that layer in the list.
In order to allocate object types to layers, double-click the pertinent row.
In the Import: Layer dialog, enter the names of the layers containing the
geometry data of the object type in question or select them from a layer
list. A layer list could exist, e.g., in a DXF file if this attribute has been saved as well. In any case you have to know the layer names.

If several layers are to be identified by common character strings, you can
also use wildcards, such as *, to substitute arbitrary strings (see chapter
2.8).
Example: 6.3.1 Roads A through F are on layer STR1, roads G through M on layer STR2.
You can import all of the roads A through M at once by entering STR* in
the Import: Layer dialog for the object type Road.
If roads A through F were to lie on layer STR1, and roads G through M on
layer ROAD, roads A through M could also be imported all at once by entering STR1|ROAD (i. e. STR1 "or" ROAD) in the Import: Layer dialog for
the object type Road.
This "allocation list" can be saved to a file for subsequent re-use by clicking the Save AS button, and can be opened again (Open button) as required.
The data will be imported after confirming with OK.

• Match Points
• Affine Transformation
• General Transformation

Delete and interpolate
height of polygon points
Delete polygon points depending on their height z
With the general transformation dialog you may also delete polygon points
from lines and areas depending on a user-defined height of the polygon
points.
This function may be useful for objects which have some points with a
height of zero while the other ones have heights greater than zero and, moreever, the distances to each other are very small. This may happen with a
file imported from a third party program.
With contour lines for e.g. you would have a very jagged digital terrain
model. In this case you may purge these objects by defining a formula in
the z-coordinate field as follows:
iif(z==0,del,z)
(if the height is 0, then delete that point, otherwise do not alter the height).
Of course you may enter a different value for zero. After confirming with
OK the affected points are deleted.
Interpolation of the height z
Instead of deleting the points if their z-heights are not desired, you may interpolate the z-height, depending on the next corresponding z-height and
the distance of these points, with the formula as follows:
iif(z==0,int,z)
Of course you may enter a different value for zero as well. After confirming with OK the affected points are interpolated.

guaranteed that CadnaA users can take advantage of all availible data
sources. Because of continuous developement it cannot be excluded that a
file format has changed and therefore the corresponting data cannot be
correctly imported. It is recommended you check a file format by importing a little test file before importing big data volume.

Hints for importing data
using the DXF
format 6.4.2
Using the DXF format to import geometry data is an option often made
use of. Many CAD programs are capable of exporting DXF files, which
means that practically all maps generated using a CAD system can be imported by CadnaA. This feature, however, is limited to geometry data –
other features and parameters are not imported. If necessary, this has to be
done in a second step using the database interface (see chapter 6.5 "Import
via ODBC Interface").
CAD systems can be used in a very flexible manner. Designers are free in
their definition of objects. Buildings need not necessarily be drawn as
closed polygon. The simplest representation consists of four individual
walls (lines). Often, heights are not given, as for many maps two-dimensional representations are sufficient.
To ensure proper interpretation of the DXF data by CadnaA, observe the
following hints:
• Allocate all drawing elements belonging to one acoustical object type
in CadnaA to one layer.
• Prior to saving the DXF file, all those elements should be removed
from the drawing (such as lettering, structural elements etc.), which are
not required for the representation of the object in CadnaA. (A lettering, e. g., is imported as a set of vectors in many small sections. This
results in more memory being used than actually necessary, which, in
turn, slows down work with your file.).
• Points, such as point sources and receiver points, are exported with x,
y, and z coordinates. When CadnaA imports them, the z co-ordinate is
interpreted as absolute height.
• All lines must be saved as polygon lines.
• Any object represented as a closed polygon in CadnaA (buildings, area
sources, built-up areas, foliage etc.) is to be represented by a closed
polygon line. For three-dimensional objects, such as buildings, the z
coordinate of each point means the absolute height of the roof. The
6.4.2 Chapter 6.4 Import Formats
AutoCad-DXF
Manual
2
6
polygon, therefore, defines the outline of the roof area.
• Save open lines such as roads, railways, line sources etc. as open polygon lines.
• In the case of roads, only the axis (centre line) can be used as a DXF
element. If the axis of several tracks are saved as lines, CadnaA will
accordingly display several parallel roads. In this case, you would have
to assign to each road the width of one of the tracks, and the traffic density applicable to that track. It is therefore much simpler just to import
the main axis of the road and then specify the road cross section as a
parameter.
Our DXF format will intercept some of the individual inputs made by
CAD users. To be able to interpret a polygon as, e. g., a building, CadnaA
requires that the polygon is closed. CadnaA will therefore assume a building to be a closed polygon, although its walls, in the CAD system, are represented by individual lines with, however, identical first and last points
(which, a priori, is not a closed polygon). If the pertinent layer name is given, the polygon is then imported as a building.
Block saving is also supported by the CadnaA DXF format, and the objects are processed accordingly.
see also chapter 11.6.5 Closing Buildings
File extension DXF 6.4.2 File names in DXF format have the extension DXF.
Import Options 6.4.2 • Object layer (see chapter 6.3.1)
• Import only in a Section (see chapter 6.3.2)
• Transformation (see chapter 6.3.4)
• Use Object heights for Polylines
• Import Blocks as Points
• Import DXF-Handle as Name
Use Object Heights for
Polylines
With the activated option CadnaA adds the z-height and the object height
from the DXF file, and defines this height as object height in CadnaA.
6.4.2 Chapter 6.4 Import Formats
AutoCad-DXF
Manual

In a CAD program the layer of an object is, e.g., defined by 15 m, the ob- Example
ject height by 20 m. This is in CadnaA an object height of 35 m, absolute.
With the activated option for the DXF-Import only, the "Insertion points" Import Blocks as Points
of the blocks will be imported.
In a CAD program if height points are drawn as crossing lines and defined Example
as block, CadnaA will import crosses instead of intersection points if the
option is deactivated.
Import DXF-Handle
as Name
Sometimes DXF files contain identifiers (ID) so-called „Handle“. Importing these in CadnaA is only useful if you also want to import interconnected parameters located in a separate database. The ID is the connecting
element between the graphic objects from the DXF file and the parameters
from the database (see chapter 6.5 "Import via ODBC Interface").
So, activate this option if the mentioned condition is to be fulfilled.
After importing the DXF file the Handle is entered automaticly in the Name box in the object dialog. Before you merge the data from a database via
the ODBC interface you have to „hand over“ the Handle from the Name
into the ID box of CadnaA.
For that, use the command from the context menu Modify Object|Swap Swap Name/ID
Name/ID.
Following a DXF import example in which two height references are con- Example
tained in a file.
DXF Import with two
heights 6.4.2
Following situation: you get a DXF file in which are saved buildings with
two heights - the base point height and the object height.
The base point height shall be imported for the digital terrain modell
(DTM) as contour lines.
The following procedure is started with File|Import|File format|AutoCad DXF:

The DXF file has to be imported twice with the below mentioned option
settings.

That’s it.
But there are probably too many contour lines imported with a slight
height difference which is surely not useful. If necessary, thin the contour
line model by deleting them or eliminate polygon points from the contour
lines with the function Modify Objects|Action: Simplify Geometry from
the context menu (see chapter 5.7.11) or generate new contour lines by
calculating a ground model (see chapter 10.8).

6.4.3 ArcView
ArcView files are shape files which were generated as exported files from
the ESRI company's Geographic Information System (GIS) using ArcView or ArcInfo software.
Possible import options:
• Object Layer (see chapter 6.3.1)
• Transformation (see chapter 6.3.4)
The GIS system is based on layers and themes. These themes are labelled
and contain objects to be specified by the user. The themes "Buildings.shp", e. g., might comprise all buildings in a city, or "Traffic Systems.shp" might include all roads.
Via the ArcView format, CadnaA is capable of exporting shape files and
importing these files, while at the same time allocating the GIS objects to
the appropriate CadnaA objects by entering the themes in the allocation
list (Options button).
Lines (ISO-dB) and areas with equal sound sources (noise map) and the
calculated receiver grid can also be exported to ArcView or ArcInfo. Data
exchange with the ArcView GIS system is thus guaranteed.
In total you will get three files with the same name but different extensions:
• the shape file with the extension „shp“ which comprises the geometrical object data;
• the database file with the extension „dBf“ with object attributes like,
e.g., object height, MDTD of a road (Mean Daily Traffic Density),
SCS/Distance of a road (Standard Cross Section) or the sound emission
level etc.;
• and a so-called index file with the extension „shx“.
For the importation, these files have to be placed together in the same directory.
6.4.3 Chapter 6.4 Import Formats
ArcView
Manual

In the dialog Import Options enter the theme/file name without the extension „shp“ as the layer name for the appropriate object type. The data
being imported is then allocated to that object type under CadnaA.
Clicking OK closes the dialog and imports the data.
Example Import of
Objects 6.4.3
Example of an import from ArcView into CadnaA:
You have at least three ArcView files in the Shape format (*.shp, *.shx,
*.dBf) and they are all in the same folder.
Within CadnaA import the shp-file with File|Import|File format: Arc
View. This file type comprises the geometrical object references.
After clicking the Option button you may allocate the ArcView files to the
appropriate object types by inputing the file names (themes) in the corresponding layer boxes. You may import several files simultanously.
) Mark, if necessary, by multiple choice (see chapter 4.10 "Mouse Buttons"), the files you would like to import.
) Afterwards click on the Option button.

) Enter the ArcView file name without the extension „shp“ and - very
important - with an asterisk (*) behind the filename in the corresponding object type of the layer boxes. The data will be imported after
confirming and closing all dialogs with OK.
In this example data is being imported which is found in the files named
bahn-lin.shp and str-lin.shp.
Automatic ID
definition
During importation a code, a combination from the name of the shape file
(e.g. bahn-lin) and the record number (e.g. 001, 002, 003 etc.), will be assigned to the objects automatically and displayed in the ID box in the object
edit dialog in, thus "bahn-lin001", „bahn-lin002“ etc.
Parameter importation
via ODBC interface
If further object parameters are available e.g. SCS/Distance of a road,
MDTD or also the building height, if this attribute has not already been
imported from the shp-file, they usually will be simultanously exported
into the file with the dBf extension. You may also import this data into
CadnaA via the ODBC interface (see chapter 6.5).
In this case you have to assign, among others, the Attribute ID to (ta- Match ID
ble+recno) from the Table Column list in order to merge the attributes
with corresponding objects with the matching IDs.

The import format MapInfo® (MapInfo Corporation, USA) enables the
importing of so-called MIF files (Ascii) which contain the geometrical references for objects like, e.g., building coordinates.
The generally supplied Ascii data file with the extension MID contains
further parameters like, e.g., object height, MDTD, or road distances etc.
which you may import via the ODBC database interface (see chapter
6.4.9).
If this is a big file, open it in Excel or ACCESS first and save it again as
XLS or mdB format. If possible use an Excel driver or something else but
not a Ascii driver. Ascii-ODBC drivers work very slowly if the data volume is big.
How many columns and which kind of data these files contain can be
looked up in the third supplied file with the extension TAB. The column
headings are usualy missing in the MID file because this reference is included in the TAB file.
If necessary adapt the new saved file accordingly: In the first row write the
column headings, delete columns which are not needed etc. Use this adopted file for the import via the ODBC database interface.

separate file from the surveyor's office or the like. It may happen, however, that the file received shows the ground plans of the buildings and,
within these ground plans, points which merely provide information on the
height of these buildings. In the latter case, you will wish to allocate the
heights of these points to the respective buildings as easily as possible.
This can be managed by means of the File Import/Export function Building Height Points.
The ASCII file contains points with x-y-z coordinates which would lie within a building
ground plan. When importing, only the z-coordinates are considered, and the height is allocated to that building in whose ground plan the respective point lies.

It may happen that you adopt building ground plans from an automated
real-estate map where no height information is supplied. The heights
would then have to be determined in some way or another (e. g. by means
of local inspection or aerial survey, etc.).
Having determined the heights, possibly at great expense, and allocated
them manually to the buildings in your CadnaA file, you will of course
wish to keep the height information even if the building ground plans are
updated.
So before transcribing your building ground plans, first export the building
heights using the export format File|Export|Building Height Points, and
save them to an ASCII file by specifying a name.
Having updated your building ground plans, just re-import the heights previously exported using the function of the same name.
* At the time of printing the manual, the format still had to be activated
by an entry in the Cadnaa.ini file. So if you do not find the entry
"Building Height Points" in your format list, please add the following

With CadnaA menu File|Database you may import data from different
data sources via ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) in your project file.
Via this interface you may also import coordinates for geometrical object
points in CadnaA like point sources, tennis sources and crossing lights.
For line or area shaped objects in CadnaA you have to import the geometry from a geografical information system (GIS) like, e.g., AtlasGis, Winput DGM (Digitales Terrain Model), MapInfo or as DXF format (6.4
Import Formats). In this case you have to link the geometrical objects with
their data to their ID (see chapter 5.5.3) to match the right data.
Which objects, or which object data, you may import via the ODBC interface can be infered from the menu File|Database|Definition|Object typs.
If you wish to access the database interface, make sure the desired ODBC
drivers are installed properly on your system. They are not necessarily installed during a default Windows software setup. As a rule, however, this
can be done later by means of a setup program. Please refer to your software manual to find out whether an ODBC interface is available for your
database program. Such an interface is available for MS Access, dBase,
Excel, Paradox, FoxPro, Oracle, etc., to name only a few.
The Control Panel of your system (Main Group in the Program Manager) usually tells you if ODBC drivers are installed on your system, or database connections have been set up.
If necessary, double-click the pertinent icon and install the desired drivers,
or configure database connections.

If the digitizer has been connected to the computer and configured, you
can digitize the coordinates of all objects (sound sources, such as roads,
parking lots, railways, receiver points, buildings, etc.) directly from the
map. In doing so, you can change at any time between digitizer magnifier,
mouse, and keyboard without having to expressly switch from one to the
other.
Upon clicking the Digitizer command on the File menu, you can select the
digitizer to be used, and configure it. The digitizer menu on the icon bar is
only available when the digitizer has been connected and configured.
Select the appropriate digitizer from the Type list box. The default setting Type 7.2
after installation of CadnaA is "Auto": Most digitizers are automatically
recognised. Try this setting first. Only if the system does not recognise
your digitizer, select its type from the list box.
If the WINTAB driver is installed on your system, CadnaA will recognise
this. In this case, the WINTAB driver will configure the digitizer, and you

* Note:
Before calling our hotline, devote some attention to your digitizer's
manual, configure the interface or the options, and try out the modified settings. Please remember that most digitizers also allow settings
to be made at the device itself. The recommended settings are displayed when you click the INFO button on the Digitizer dialog. If all
else fails, we will be pleased to help you.
Interface 7.2 Once a digitizer has been selected from the list of types, all settings except
the port that remains to be selected should be correct. You can still modify
the settings. To this end, select the appropriate value on the pertinent list
box. You can check the functioning of the digitizer before first using it by
clicking the Test button.
Test 7.2 1. Test correct co-ordinate transfer:
Continuously increasing x and y values should be displayed on the
screen while you move the magnifier in a preferably straight line
from the left to the right, across the tablet, and from the bottom to the
top of the tablet, respectively, without pressing a button.
If this is not so, the settings are not yet correct.
2. Test the magnifier buttons:
The check boxes corresponding to Buttons 1 through 4 should be
checked when you press the respective buttons on the magnifier.
CadnaA uses buttons 1 and 4 only. Button 1 is used to select a toolbar
icon, and to position polygon points. Button 4 serves to terminate the
insertion.

When you press a magnifier button, the corresponding Button check 7
box in the dialog is activated to show you which button is button 1
and button 4 to CadnaA. The button designation need not be the
same as on the magnifier.
If, e. g., button 0 on the magnifier is pressed, and Button 1 is checked
in the dialog, button 0 on the magnifier is button 1 to CadnaA .

7.3 Digitizing
Use a map - one with a scale of, e. g., 1:1,000 to digitize the objects
In order to be able to digitize objects from a map, you must know either
the scale or the co-ordinates of at least two reference points on the map.
This allows you to enter or calculate the width and height (limits) of the
map in terms of coordinates.
7.3 Chapter 7 Digitalize
Digitizing
Manual

7
At least these limits must be defined on the CadnaA Options menu. (see
Chapter 13.2 ).
In the case of the map above, the limits would be defined by the lower-left
corner, 0/0, and the upper-right corner, 308/415. This comprises the entire
map.
If you know only the scale - 1:1,000 for example - you can draw a reference line of 10 cm on the map, and enter the coordinates of its first and last
points.
With the scale as given above, the reference line is 100 m. If you were to
position this reference line at the lower-left corner of the map, you could
enter this point as having x and y coordinates 0/0. The last point of the reference line would then have the coordinates 100/0. These points would
then be the reference points for this map.
The more reference points are given - the maximum being four - the smaller the deviations in the position coordinates of the objects to be digitized.
In order to start digitizing, select the icon on the icon bar. In the dialog
which then opens, calibrate the map on the digitizer. To achieve this, you
need the reference points.
7.3 Chapter 7 Digitalize
Digitizing
Manual

First, enter the co-ordinates of the reference points. Up to four reference
points can be entered. These can be saved in the reference point list to be
re-used when the map is needed again later.
In order to save, click the Save button, enter a name, and close the "Save
Reference Points" dialog by clicking OK.
In order to re-use saved co-ordinates, click the list box arrow and select the
pertinent name. This results in the co-ordinates being written to the edit
boxes.
The option "Enter Tablet Menu" (see further below) allows direct activation of the toolbox objects in the CadnaA main window by means of the
digitizer. To this end, activate this option.
Having entered all required data - the tablet menu and the map to be digitized are lying on the digitizer - close the "Calibrate Digitizer" dialog by
clicking OK.
Cadna now expects you to enter the corresponding reference points by
clicking them on the map using the digitizer magnifier. The reference point
co-ordinates entered are also displayed during this process.
You can use the zoom magnifiers at your convenience. If necessary, first
zoom out in order to facilitate finding the reference point, then zoom in
again on the area, so as to allow precise clicking of the point.
If the option "Enter Tablet Menu" is active, you will be prompted to enter
further reference points defining the position of this menu on the digitizer.
If under File|Digitizer|Options, the resolution of the digitizer has been
specified, CadnaA will display the scale of the map for checking as soon
as all reference points have been digitized.
Now you can start digitizing the individual objects.
Please note: When inserting objects by digitizing, you can choose
• to start by entering all co-ordinate points belonging to one polygon
line, and assign heights to these points afterwards, or
7.3 Chapter 7 Digitalize

log by double-clicking. Clicking the Geometry button opens the Geometry dialog containing a coordinate table in which the heights of the points
are entered.
We want to digitize a road. The common form for documentation of a road Second Option
indicates absolute heights at specific cross sections (see the figure below).
In order to properly model the curvature of a polygon, we need to enter
points between these cross sections for which the heights are indicated.
This series of points is numbered on the figure. In the example, absolute
heights are known at points 1, 7, and 12. For all other points, which are
only required to properly model the curvature, heights are interpolated.
This calculation can be performed automatically by CadnaA.
1. After clicking the road icon or pressing CTRL+S, we digitize the first
two points.
2. We switch to the edit mode by pressing CTRL+E.
3. Having double-clicked the polygon line generated on the screen, we
can enter the parameters for this section.
Although you can also do this later, it is recommended we enter all
parameters immediately because CadnaA adopts these values for the
following polygon points until you enter new values. In this example,
the cross section b2 is chosen from the list.

8. Switch to the next point by pressing the arrow button.
It may be faster using the keyboard. The hotkey ALT+SHIFT+ >
(move forward through list) bring us to the next point where we can
immediately enter the next value in the box already selected. When
using the hotkey, we will always automatically hop to the last edited
box on the preceding record.
* If we do not know the height and wish CadnaA to calculate the
unknown height, we delete the value in the z co-ordinate box using
the DEL or SPACE key. The box must be blank.
CadnaA then provides interpolated values. We can check this by reopening the geometry dialog when all points have been entered.
9. We press ALT+N with the coordinate dialog still open (or we click the

New button) to create a new point.
10. Click this third point on the digitizer tablet using the digitizer magnifier. The coordinates in the active dialog are updated (when a new
point is created, its x and y coordinates are set to 0/0).
11. Enter the height of the third point from the keyboard, or delete it (the
value on the Height box is already selected).
12. Proceed as from 10. ....ALT+N .... etc. until all points have been digitized.
* If a track distance and/or a transverse slope is given in the Geometry
table, the program will adopt these values for all following polygon
points until we insert a new value. All subsequent points are then
assigned the new value. For those points, for which the preceding
value applies, no value is listed on the table.
Consequently, when calculating, the preceeding value is taken into
account for an empty box in the table in the column Distance (m)
and Slope (%).

8.2 General and Special Sources
In the calculation CadnaA is capable of taking into account the emissions General Sources
of general sources (see there) in combination with single-number or frequency-dependent values. After a frequency-dependent calculation, the
rating level at the receiver point will also be given in frequency bands.
Spectra are entered in the local or global libraries (see Chapter 16.2), and
are referred to in the edit dialog of the source by entering their ID (see
Chapter 5.5.3). Spectra may have different weightings.
Special
Sources 8.2
Special sources, such as
• Roads (see Chapter 8.9)
• Railways (see Chapter 8.12)
• Parking Places (see Chapter 8.13)
• Traffic Lights (see Chapter 8.10)
• Tennis Serve Points (see Chapter 8.8)
require either an input of an emission value (Lme) or other parameters
from which the emission value is calculated (parameters, e.g., such as
MDTD, counts, speeds, or train classes). These parameters are usually
necessary according to the selected guideline or standard.
For the insertion of objects, please refer to chapter 5.3 "Insert Objects".
The general sources like
• Point, (see Chapter 8.3)
• Line (see Chapter 8.4) and
• Area Sources (see Chapter 8.5), horizontal and vertical,
can be used to simulate various noise sources, including the sound radiation from buildings. They can also have a directional sound ratiation (see
Chapter 8.7).
By specifying an object snap (see Chapter 13.5), the point and vertical area
sources are placed at a user-defined distance in front of the building facade. This serves to prevent any source from erroneously being placed inside a building.

Point sources are noise sources whose dimensions are small in comparison
to the distance from the point sources to the receiver points. Examples are
ventilation inlets and outlets, pumps, motors, and people shouting.

Line sources are open polygons.
Line sources are noise sources extending in only one direction, while the
dimensions in the other two orthogonal directions are small as compared
to the distance to the receiver points. Examples are pipelines, conveyor
belts, and traffic routes on a factory site.
When performing a calculation for an receiver point, CadnaA subdivides
the line source in a two-step procedure: First, the line source is subdivided
into sections being shielded and sections not being shielded by any of the
shielding objects lying between the receiver point and the source (see
Chapter 12.2.3 "The Projection Method for extended Sound Sources").
Then, in the second step, the distance between the receiver point and each
section is determined and, if the length of a section exceeds the mandatory
distance criterion, a further subdivision is made.

8.5 Area Source
Area sources are closed polygons.
Area sources are noise sources extending in two perpendicular directions,
while the dimension in the third perpendicular direction is small in relation
to the distance from the area source to the immission points.
Area sources are plane surfaces surrounded by a closed line which you
may imagine as a fine grid of point sources. This is also what CadnaA
does during the calculation: The area is subdivided into sufficiently small
partial areas, each of which is replaced at the centre by a substitute point
source with the appropriate partial sound power.
Area Source
horizontal 8.5
Horizontal area sources are inserted by entering their horizontal projection.
Examples of area sources are parking lots (see Chapter 8.13), sports facilities, and even entire industrial or commercial areas.
Area Source
vertical 8.5
Vertical area sources are inserted by entering their horizontal projection as
an open polygon line.
When performing a calculation for an receiver point, CadnaA subdivides
the area source in a two-step procedure: First, the area source is subdivided
into partial areas being shielded and partial areas not being shielded by any
of the shielding objects lying between the receiver point and the source
(see Chapter 12.4.4 "Projection of:"). Then, in the second step, the distance between the receiver point and each partial area is determined and, if
the largest dimension of a partial area exceeds the mandatory distance criterion, a further subdivision is made.

Geometric definition of the vertical area source
If, e. g., a window, as illustrated below, is to be considered as a sound-radiating area, enter the window in the horizontal projection by inserting the
vertical area source as a polygon line at a short distance in front of the facade. For a clear distinction, a distance of approximately 0.05 m is appropriate. This distance is automatically obtained by specifying it on the
Object Snap dialog (see Chapter 13.5 Options|Object Snap).

In the edit dialog of the vertical area source, specify the position of the top
edge under Geometry|Height. As with any other object, this height may
be given as relative or absolute value, or with respect to the roof of a building (the latter being particularly convenient when entering vents for a lantern roof). The bottom edge is then specified according to the z dimension
as illustrated.
Complicated outlines of vertical sound-radiating areas are approximated
by several rectangular areas.
For the calculation, the vertical area source is replaced by a series of line
sources with a spacing of 1 m. These are then subdivided into sections as
described above.

• area source, horizontal or vertical
you may choose to enter the emission value in terms of the total sound
power level, PWL, or the sound power level per unit area (per square
meter), PWL’'.
If the sound power level per unit length, PWL’, is entered for a line source, Result PWL 8.6
or the sound power level per unit area, PWL’’, is entered for an area
source, the total sound power level resulting from the dimensions of the
source in question is displayed as Result PWL.
As the height of the terrain at the polygon points is not yet known when
the values are entered, this total sound power level will, if relative heights
were used, refer to the horizontal projection of the source. Consequently, it
8.6 Chapter 8 Noise Sources
The Edit Dialog of a Source

is not yet correct for inclined line or area sources. During the calculation,
however, even in this case, the absolute height at the polygon points is calculated, and the correct total sound power level is determined.
* Consequence: If sound power levels per unit length or unit area are
entered for inclined line or area sources whose heights were given as
relative coordinates, the total value displayed under Result PWL is
not yet correct. It will be so, however, after the first calculation.
To be able to follow the example below, you should be familiar with
• the basic techniques (see <Absatz-Standardschrift>Chapter 5 Basics)

8.6.1 A-weighted Emission Value
If we select Single Band, the sound power level entered under PWL - 104 Single band 8.6.1
in the example - is interpreted as the total level. All frequency-dependent
calculations are performed for the frequency entered in the Hz box to the
right.
To consider different emissions for day-time and night-time, you can Correction 8.6.1
specify a Correction for each of these periods.
) In the example, the night-time level is set to lie 10 dB(A) below the
day-time level by entering a correction of -10.
The total level resulting from all inputs - except for operating time and
K0 - which is used in the calculation of sound propagation is displayed under Result PWL.
If, as in the example, the Sound Reduction box is deactivated, the dialog
deals with the direct radiation of airborne sound from an outdoor source.
(See below for the radiation from buildings, which applies when the
Sound Reduction option is active.)
If a number is entered under Attenuation, this value is interpreted as the
reduction in level occurring during propagation from the point where the
sound is generated to the point of radiation. It is, therefore, reduced from
the sound power level.
In the example, a fan having a daytime sound power level of 104 dB(A)
could be equipped with a downstream silencer reducing the sound power
level by 8 dB(A).
) Enter 8 in the Attenuation box, and watch the change in the Result
PWL.
You may also enter complex formulas or the ID of a spectrum in the Attenuation box.

In the present case, with different attenuations, the airborne sound radiated into a duct by the fan could be attenuated by, e. g., bends, changes in the
pipe cross section, fittings, and silencers. The remaining effective portion
of sound radiated from the outlet is then described in terms of the resulting
sound power level. To simulate this, enter, for example,
8+4+3.5+2
on the Attenuation line. You could, of course, determine a single-number
value from this sum and enter this directly, but giving the details as shown
above has the advantage that the formula, and thus the individual attenuations, will be recorded in the pertinent column of the source lists.
The line will, however, cope with far more complex formulas.
) Try, e. g.,
((8+4+3.5+2)++17.5)--19)
As described for other input boxes, ++ stands for the energy-equivalent (or

Sound Radiation from Building Facades
All types of general sources explained above can be used to simulate the
sound radiation from buildings. For example, you may simulate the slottype openings on all sides of a multi-storey garage (see Chapter 20.3
"Modeling Multiple Storey Garages") by entering circumferential line
sources.
In order to mark a building facade as a sound-radiating area, and to be able
to calculate the emission from the indoor level, activate Reduction on the
edit dialog of a sound source and enter in the pertinent box the sound reduction index in terms of a single number or the ID code of a spectrum for
a sound reduction index. All techniques for the selection of spectra from
the libraries and the handling of user-defined formulas, which were described under Point Source, apply as always.
If the checkbox Reduction is activated, but the Reduction is zero we must
enter the value 0. A sound level cannot be calculated if the field is empty.

8.6.5 Sound-radiating Area (m²)
For line and point sources which simulate radiating surfaces, the sound-radiating area must always be entered when the calculation is to be performed on the basis of an indoor level. To this end, click the check box,
and enter the relevant area.
For a vertical or horizontal area source, an input is only required where the
actual sound-radiating area differs from the geometrical area of the area
source.
The sound radiation from a glass facade is simulated by a vertical area Exampel
source in front of it. The massive parts of the facade, which do not radiate
sound, are accounted for by entering the area of the actual glass surfaces.
If the Area (m²) check box is not activated, CadnaA considers the entire
area source in the calculation. Enter a value, if this is not desired.
* Always watch the Result PWL. As long as it is set to 0, parameters
are still missing. When calculating on the basis of the indoor level,
this might be, e. g., the area or the sound reduction index.
The length (m) of the line source and the area of the area source (m²) can
be seen in the Geometry dialog. For the vertical area source - drawn with
only two polygon points - this value is 0, as the area entered refers to the

If, on the other hand, the check box is activated when performing a calculation for an receiver point, the time intervals entered under Day/Recreation/Night are considered as the operating times of the source. A penalty
is added to the level for the time period entered under Recreation, which
can be specified on the Calculation|Configuration|Reference Time tab.
In this case, the average level of daytime sound pressure is determined in
view of the times entered for Day and Recreation. The applied time-interval correction results from the operating times entered and the reference

8.7 Directional Sound Radiation
Not all sound sources radiate sound uniformly in all directions. There is,
for example, a directivity of the radiated sound for power-plant chimneys,
which depends on the exhaust velocity of the gas and its temperature. But
there are many other examples, such as the ground run-up of aeroengines
in a test facility, or the blow-off from valves, where the sound pressure level is not the same for all directions and not only a function of the distance.
In order to account for this fact, directional sound radiation was integrated
into CadnaA, both in a general way and for specific source types.
When a point source is specified, the pertinent option button in the edit
source dialog lets you assign a directivity to that source.

lines spaced 15 degrees. This form allows to define an axial symetric directivity pattern, that is sufficient in most cases. (A complete general description would effort the directivity index in each frequency band
independance of two angles). With Name a string is entered, which can be
refered to in the PWL input line of any point-, line- or area source during
calculation.
The form allows to enter the directivity indices for all octave bands from
31.5 Hz to 8000 Hz in angular increments of 15 degrees. If values are only
available for larger increments, use the DEL key to delete the zeros for the
15-degree-increments where no such values are available. CadnaA will

Polygon Point. Select the option: absolute Height at every Point from
the list below the coordinate table.
The lateral slope refers to the outer lane axis which is rotated around the
road’s centre-line. A positive value lifts the outer right lane, a negative value the outer left lane. Right and left refer to the initial point when looking
toward the final point.
* The entered value is valid for all the following points. Therefore we

8.9.8 Correction for Multiple Reflections
According to RLS-90, first-order reflections are to be taken into account
by considering first-order mirror sound sources in addition to the original
sound source "Road". This is done automatically if, on the tab Calculation|Configuration|Road, the option Strictly according to RLS-90 (see
Chapter 12.4.9) is activated, no matter which order of reflection was specified on the tab Calculation|Configuration|Reflection (see Chapter
12.4.7).
If the option Strictly according to RLS-90 is deactivated, however, any
reflection may be excluded by specifying 0 as the order of reflection in the
Calculation|Configuration.
If there are closed built-up areas on both sides of the road, the resulting excess level has to be accounted for by an additional correction for multiple
reflections, which depends on the average height of both built-up areas and
on the distance between them.
We can enter the correction for multiple reflections after clicking the Options button in the edit dialog.
This is the excess sound level due to multiple reflections. Drefl dB(A) 8.9.8
If this item is activated in the edit dialog Road, you can enter a level in the

pressure level that would result from a single vehicle or other source with
a specified emission travelling along that line.
Generating this level characteristic allows you to check very effectively,
e. g.,
• whether the effect of a noise-control device, such as a barrier, would be
sufficient for all affected partial areas,
• which noise reduction may be expected by providing a reflecting building facade with absorbent cladding, or
• by which amount the sound pressure level resulting from single motor
vehicles travelling by is reduced if, e. g., a zone with a speed limit of
30 km/h is established in an ordinary inner-city street.

) Test the Pass-By with a simple arrangement as in the following Pass-By.cna
figure.
Simple arrangement of a road, buildings and a receiver point IP1.
) Open the context menu by clicking the road axis with the RIGHT
mouse key and selcet the command Pass-By Level.
) From the Imm.point (receiver point) list select the desired receiver
point for which the pass-by level shall be calculated - in our example
IP1.
) In the next box, Source Type, select „light“.
) Adjust the Sampling Interval to 0.1 s.
After we have confirmed with OK the diagram opens with the calculated level’s time history. The calculation time depends on the complexity of the project.

8.15 Optimized Area Sources
* This source is only available if the BPL module was purchased!
Clicking this icon allows you to specify the boundary of a maximized area
source. The source is characterised by the following features.
• The method for the calculation of sound propagation is done as it was
for the general area source (see Chapter 8.5), i. e., the area is split into
partial areas taking into account its distance from the receiver point and
possible shielding objects. The partial areas are replaced by point
sources.
• When determining noise quotas using Maximized Area Sources you
should generally activate the option so that shielding objects within do
not affect the emission of area sources. This option is available for any
area source. (see Chapter 12.4.8 Calculation|Configuration|Industry|Src. in buildings/Cylinders do not shield.)
• The edit dialog can be switched from day-time to night-time. The entry
of either the area-related sound power level PWL’’ or the total sound
power level PWL refers to the respective time.
• By the other entries in the bottom part of the dialog, the Maximized
Area Sources differs from a general area source. These entries support
the maximalisation with respect to the allocation of noise quotas.
8.15 Chapter 8 Noise Sources
Optimized Area Sources
Manual

The procedure is explained below.
If immission-sensitive residential areas are situated in the vicinity of a
planned trade or industrial area the latter is so partitioned as to provide individual areas with different maximum permissible emissions. These permissible emission values are determined under the condition that:
• the relevant immission limits for the neighbourhood are complied with
in any case, and
• the intended use of the individual areas is prevented or restricted in the
least possible way
This generally is called noise allotment. CadnaA supports this in an extremely flexible manner using the Maximized Area Source, without forcing the user to follow a particular program-inherent philosophy of
maximalization.
In order to achieve this, a usability function is assigned to each partial
area.

It assigns an area-related usability in % to each area-related sound power
level. The fact that the gradient of the curve decreases as the emission values increase shows that a further increase in the permissible emission cannot be exploited due to the intended use. On the other hand, the usability
decreases excessively when a particular emission required for the intended
use is further reduced.
Thanks to this concept /19/ the individual requirements of planning concerning institutions and parties can be accounted for in the maximalisation.
The usability function of CadnaA is approximated by two lines. This requires three emission values for each partial area as a basis for the maximalisation.
PWL’’ max is the maximum exploitable emission (depending
on the branch of industry - value may be up to
80 dB(A) for industries with permanent truck
traffic)
8.15 Chapter 8 Noise Sources
Optimized Area Sources
Manual

The usability specified at the turning point determines the curve and thus
the "maximalising strategy".
Common data for industrial areas::
The bottom part of the edit dialog for the Optimized Area Source contains a slider control serving to select an emission value within the range
from min to max like the current value which is displayed in the dialog
above. For a first test, push the slider to the extreme right, thus selecting
the maximum emission value.
PWL’’ min is the minimum required emission [determined on
the basis of the absolutely necessary noise-relevant processes - e. g. a 10-minute truck ride
across an area of 1,000 m2
 results in 55 dB(A).]
PWL Turning
Point
is the emission value where the gradient of the usability function changes. Below the turning point
level, a 1-dB reduction results in a stronger reduction in usability than a 1-dB increase in the range
above, and enhances the usability. Here we
should enter the value that should be "retained" in
the maximalisation.
PWL’’ min 57 dB(A)
Turning Point 80 % / 60 dB(A)
PWL’’ max 65 dB(A)

Calculation
8.15.0
The most critical receiver points are entered with their relevant standard
immission levels as customary. Clicking the calculator icon on the icon bar
starts the calculation. If no receiver point turns red for either day or night,
the standard levels are complied with in spite of the maximum values
which were assumed - in this case it is not necessary to reduce emission
values.
In the calculation, all sources existing in the project - roads, railways, industry or even air-traffic noise - are taken into account as the initial immission. The individual or group (see Chapter 18.2) deactivation, or
deactivation of entire types of noise sources allows you to generate and analyse any scenario for large limits.
The procedure described so far is the same as for the calculation of ordinary area sources.
Manual
Maximalisation 8.15.0
If red colour shows that the standard levels have been exceeded at individual receiver points, the emission from the partial areas with the strongest
influence on the relevant point are reduced in steps.
CadnaA does not require a new calculation for each step. Double-clicking
the respective partial area and shifting the position of the slider will show
you the resulting change of receiver points in the graphic - practically online. Depending on the desired strategy the emission values can be reduced
until compliance with the standard levels is ensured at all receiver points.

* Follow this procedure separately for day-time and night-time.
Automatic
Maximalization 8.15.0
Selecting Optimized Area Sources on the Calculation menu will result
in an automatic, iterative reduction of the emission values by CadnaA. It is
always the reduction of emission resulting in the smallest decrease of the
area-related usability according to the concept explained above which is
carried out in this stepwise procedure.
With
the total usability is
Its value is displayed at the beginning and the end of the maximalization.
The result calculated by CadnaA need not be the best if further aspects,
not accessible to the above usability function, are to be considered. In this
case, the automatic optimisation is a suitable starting point, whereas manual modifications of the emission values using the slider (see above: Manual Maximalisation) allow you to further adapt the scenario in the desired
way.
When the maximalisation has been completed and fixed, the Optimized
Area Source can be converted to an general area source (see Chapter
5.7.14). This is particularly useful where large data stocks are to be supplemented for noise immission maps.

which is defined by the roof top.)
Reflections at the outer surfaces of the building will be taken into account
according to the mirror sound source method if this option has been selected under Calculation|Configuration (see Chapter 12.4.7).
Sources will be shielded if the are lying within the building because their
facades are be taken into account as barriers. We can determine this by activating or deactivating the option Sources in Buildings/Cylinders do not
shield on the tab Industry in Calculation|Configuration (see Chapter
12.4.8 "Industry Tab").

General Sources
With a value larger than zero the defined percentage of the sound energy
is added to the diffracted sound energy when the sound energy is attenuated by diffraction with transparency zero. This property and the described
effect in the calculation method, is only active with industrial noise, that
means with the general point-, line- and area-sources calculated according
to VDI-guideline 2714 /2720 or ISO 9613-2
This feature allows the modeling of more or less open structures that are in
reality an accumulation of pipes, vessels and other technical equipment
that can be penetrated by sound energy. This modeling is performed with
the object Building which has the same shape as the described structure,
and a transparency value that is derived from the open cross section.
In the most general case several objects lie in the path of propagation. Effect
At first we check, which of these objects influence the diffraction calculation according to the rubber-band method (small objects that don't touch a
rubber stretched from source to receiver point remain unconsidered).
If the sound energy at the receiver point is reduced by dE according to the
screening calculation, then with a collective transparency of X % the energy (X/100)*dE is added to the sound energy calculated with transparency
zero.
The total degree of transmission for many buildings is the product of all
single transmission factors.
The calculation method with CadnaA is as follows:
At the receiver point two sound contributions are added energetically. The
first contribution is the diffracted sound over and if necessary around the
arrangement and is calculated as for objects not acoustically transparent.
9.3.1 Chapter 9.3 Building
Acoustic Transparency (%)
Manual

The second contribution is calculated as direct sound energy, not taking
into account the shielding objects, but multiplying this energy value by the
resulting transmission factor defined above.
With direct sound contribution Edir and the resulting transmission factor τ,
this second contribution is Edir * τ.
* Attention: This method was implemented because of user demands.
It is not described in any standard or guideline. The expanding of
transparently defined objects has no influence on the result of calculation. The value of the acoustic transparency is considered to be the
same for all directions.

If this option is activated in Calculation|Configuration|Industry the general sources as point-, line- and area sources can be placed within the
building plan. The building, in which the sources are placed, does not affect the emission of these sources. For other sources and receiver points
outside the building a shielding calculation will be taken into account according to the choosen configuration.
With this option the radiation out of almost open structures can be carried Application
out. So a plant, consisting of open bundles of pipelines, can be modeled as

9.3.5 The Building Evaluation
According to the requirements of RLS 90 /8/ and using the map symbols
defined in this guideline, there is a fairly simple way of demonstrating for
a building close to a traffic route whether the predefined and maximum
permissible rate levels on the basis of designated land use have been exceeded. It is also possible to ascertain which storeys this is true for and
which values are to be expected at the most exposed position of the facade
during the day and night.
Procedure:
) We activate - for better understanding and not because it is necessary Industry.cna
- the option No calculation of Building Noise Map in the menu
Options|Building Noise Map (see Chapter 9.3.6).
) Insert the object Building Evaluation with the corresponding icon
from the toolbox. For that, click inside the building plan for that building for which an evaluation is supposed to be made.
) After placing the first symbol we should adjust the size if necessary
(see Chapter 5.4.3 "Change Dimensions"). All further inserted symbols then have the same size.
* If several or even all buildings of a project shall be evaluated we can
use the command from the context menu Modify Object|Action:
Generate Building Evaluation to insert the Building Evaluation
symbols all at once (see Chapter 5.7.2 "Modify Objects").
In this case CadnaA automatically places these symbols in the
selected buildings. The name of the building, entered in the identically named edit box in the edit dialog, will be automatically transfered into the corresponding box of the Building Evaluation.
We then adjust the symbol sizes via the table Building Evaluation

) Double-clicking on the building evaluation icon opens the corresponding dialog. Activate the appropriate option for the standard values
(see Chapter 11.2.1).
If the option Determine from Designated Land Use is deactivated,
you can select the type of area by clicking the card-index icon next to

with respect to road traffic noise
The second way is to click the Designated Land Use icon and assign a type
of land use to an area by drawing a closed line around it. Then activate Determine from Designated Land Use. The standard values to be compared
should then be known.
When all buildings have been provided with a building evaluation symbol,
and the calculation is triggered by clicking the icon Calculator on the icon
bar, the progress bar window will first display the calculation for the specified receiver points and then the progress of the building evaluation.
In this building evaluation, calculations are performed and evaluated one

9.3.8 Level-Difference-Map for Building Noise
With the Noise-Map for Buildings and activated variants we can quickly
calculate the differences in levels at buildings in various project scenarios
and can represent them easily.
Therefore, at first we calculate the noise maps for buildings for all variants
with Calculation|Calc|All Variants. If we switch through the variants by
selecting the variant name at the symbol bar the pertinent result is displayed on the screen.
To better recognize the levels, displayed in the symbols, deactivate the option Color Symbols according to Level, if necessary, or choose a different color palette with Open Palette in the menu Grid|Appearence|
Option (see Chapter 11.5.2).
Calculate Level
Differences
We calculate the level differences by subtracting the results of the variants.
For that, open the dialog Options|Building Noise Map and enter the pertinent formula in the box Arithmetic/actual Variant.
Example: Noise Map in
Levels differences for
Buildings
We calculate the first variante V01 with the actual situation and the second
variant V02 with the actual situation plus noise protection measures, e.g. a
noise protection wall. What level differences does the noise protection
wall gain at the facades?
After calculating all variants (Calculation|Calc|All Variants), we create
another variant, e.g., V03 - differences - and activate this by selecting its
name from the list box in the symbol bar.
In the dialog Options|Building Noise Map|Arithmetic/actual Variant
we enter the following:
LPT1 - LPT2
Click the button Perform Calculation. The button Apply displays the result immediately without closing the dialog. Otherwise close the dialog by
clicking the OK button.
9.3.8 Chapter 9.3 Building

We can enter LPT01 or just LPT1.
* In this example the variant V03 will be overwritten if we calculate all
variants again. The calculation of the level differences must be
refreshed. The map of level differences for buildings is always displayed in the activated variant and therefore overwrites the existing
result.
The functions, which you can use in the Arithmetic box, are identical with
those from the Result Table.

Reflections at the outer surfaces of a barrier are taken into account according to the mirror sound source method if
1. a reflection > 0 is selected (see Chapter 12.4.7) and
2. a barrier is defined as reflecting by entering a Reflection Loss or,
alternatively, an Absorption Coefficient Alpha in the edit dialog.
The standard setting of a barrier is No Reflection. But we can define a Reflection Loss or an Absorption Coefficient Alpha for the left and/or right
side of a barrier. Left and right refer to the view from the inital point to the
final point of a barrier’s polygon points.
Strict provisions are made by RLS-90 /8/ concerning the neglecting of lateral diffraction and of ground attenuation in the calculation of the shielding effect. For all other sources you may define on the tab
Calculation|Configuration|Industry (see Chapter 12.4.8) to what extent
lateral diffraction shall be taken into account and, if necessary, you may
modify the barrier coefficients.

9.5.1 The floating Barrier
The Cadna object Barrier was modified to also include barriers on bridges.
The Floating Barrier option is available in the edit dialog Barrier. If this
option is activated, the height of the barrier from its bottom to top edges
can be entered in the z dimension box, in addition to the height specified in
the Geometry dialog. If the height of the barrier (i. e., the relative height
of its top edge) is, e. g., 10 m, and 3 m have been entered as its
z dimension, the bottom edge is 7 m above the ground.
Such a barrier whose bottom edge does not rest on the ground has the following properties:
1. The shielding effect is calculated as customary for each ray hitting
the actual barrier surface, considering all three propagation paths
(over, under and laterally around the barrier), if necessary.
2. Rays passing underneath the barrier’s edge are not attenuated. This
effect is therefore calculated correctly.
3. Diffraction around the bottom edge is – currently – not taken into
account.
4. Reflections of rays hitting the barrier’s surface are calculated according to the principle of mirror image source, if necessary. This allows
you tocalculate the increase in level caused by, e. g., large indicator
boards and similar items.
) If a barrier is installed on a bridge (see below), the height of the barrier section on the bridge must be entered as either
- the height of the top edge above the base plate of the bridge, and
the Building Height button in the Geometry dialog must be
activated - that means 3 m in our example - and the same value
must be entered for the z dimension after Floating Barrier has
been activated, or
9.5.1 Chapter 9.5 The Barriers

- the height of the top edge as an absolute value – thus 13 m in
our example. The z dimension remains the same (3 m).
* In both cases, further polygon points must be inserted (see Chapter
5.4.1) for the barrier where it intersects contour lines.
The barrier is calculated correctly in both cases.

The object type "Bridge" considerably extends the modelling capacities,

CADNA A's 3-D view of a bridge
* The CadnaA bridge is a horizontal slab with a closed polygon as its
borderline. All sound rays not hitting the bridge remain unaffected
by it.
* If a source lies above the bridge level and a direct sound ray intersects the slab, the shielding by the slab (edges) will be calculated for
receiver points not directly under the bridge-slab.
* For sound rays from sources lying below the bridge, which, on their
path to receiver points above the bridge, intersect the slab, the shielding effect is also calculated considering the top edge of the bridge as
the diffracting edge.

* Diffraction to the space below the bridge is not considered – results
under the bridge are irrelevant!
* For the time being, the bridge-slab is always a plane and parallel to
the reference plane, regardless of the contour of the terrain.
* The height is always that of the first point (accessible via the Geometry dialog, or directly via Tables|Obstacles|Bridge). Heights
entered for the other corner points in the Geometry dialog are irrelevant. (The currently used standard dialog for the entry of polygon
lines will be adapted for bridges at a later point in time.)
* When objects on the bridge-slab are to be allocated a height, the
slab is regarded as a building roof – which means that you can
directly enter the height above the level of the bridge-slab in the Geometry dialog after activating the Building Roof option.
* In the sectional view, the bridge-slab is not represented (for the time
being).
This means that road constructions of this kind can be correctly considered acoustically. The sound at ground level resulting from a road or a railway on a bridge nearby are calculated correctly and directly by
considering diffraction around the edges of the bridge.
* Rays passing below the bridge, which, for a bridged gap in an
embankment, result in sound sources on one side of the embankment
and cause a sound on the other side, are considered automatically
(see example "Bridged Gap in an Embankment").
Thanks to an extension of the definition of barriers, even barriers on a
bridge can be calculated correctly (see Chapter 9.5.1 "The floating Barrier").

9.7.1 Automatically Optimize Noise Barriers
CadnaA is able to determine autonomously the required height of a noise
protection wall/barrier which is needed to obey given maximum levels by
means of iterative calculation.
* Because of the object’s structure, for such an optimization we have to
use the object Embankment and not the object Barrier.
The following simple example shows the course of events:
Road with a Noise Barrier and a Receiver Point
The represented road exceeds the permitted value at the receiver point.
Therefore a noise barrier shall be constructed in the given position in such
a way that the permitted value is not exceeded.
* To perform an optimizing calculation it is absolutely necessary to
assign the relevant maximum value as Standard Level (dBA) to the
receiver points. It is of no significance if you enter the maximum
value directly or have it determined out of the type of land use. (In
that case, do not forget to insert an area of Designated Land Use, see
Chapter 11.4)

With every step of the calculation a barrier section is raised by the value
given in „element height“. The longer the calculation takes the shorter the

The result of multiplying Element height by Maximum number of elements is the upper limit for the height of the barrier.
In the following combo box you can select the name „area“ or enter any
other name, e.g., the product name of a noise barrier. In the first case the
value 1, in the four subsequent boxes, will remain unchanged and optimization is executed in a way that the entire surface of the noise protection
wall is minimized. With the setting A the further sample calculation is executed.
The setting B in the right figure takes into consideration the fact that the
costs per square-meter can depend on the height of the noise barrier because costs for a foundation have to be apportioned and because, with the
increasing height of the wall, greater wind pressures will have to be withstood. Optimizing is then executed in a way that will minimize the total
cost.
Please note that the combo box cost/m² must not be left without an entry.
The cost schedule of a noise barrier can be saved/deleted with the corresponding buttons. A saved cost schedule, valid for all projects, will be at

In the following example a noise barrier will be positioned in the given location in front of a gap in a way that a maximum value, given for the receiver point behind the gap, can be maintained.
Initial Situation
In this case the wall is subdivided into 42 elements with a width of 1 m.
This leads to a contour of the upper edge of the wall as shown in the graphic below. Calculation was executed strictly according to RLS90 with
buildings considered as non-reflecting.

Now calculation is repeated with builidings considered as reflecting, and
integration of reflexions up to the 5th order are included. Inclination will
also be considered in deviation from the regulations of RLS90. This is appropriate because the represented situation can only be dealt with insufficiently by following the RLS90. As the result shows, a much higher wall
would be necessary to meet this non-trivial situation.

9.8 Areas with Specified Ground
Absorption
By default, CadnaA calculates point, line, and area sources on the basis of
the frequency-independent excess attenuation due to the effects of the
ground and meteorological effects as specified in the guideline VDI 2714 /
15/, sub-clause 6.3. It is to the disadvantage of this method that special
sound propagation conditions such as the considerably enhanced sound
propagation over, e. g., reflecting water surfaces or concrete-sealed industrial courts is not taken into account.
In such cases, it is possible to apply the calculation method described in
VDI 2714, Annex D, or in ISO 9613–2 /20/.
Frequency-dependent
Calculation
This method is frequency-dependent. The levels in the individual frequency bands are affected to different extents. For the application of this method, CadnaA therefore requires:
) frequency spectra to be entered for the emissions of sound sources
instead of the mere A-weighted sound power levels.
) frequency-dependent calculation must to be selected in the edit dialog of the source.
) the option Calculation|Configuration|Industry|Ground
Attenuation Spectral must to be activated.
) Running CadnaA and inserting a point source near the left border of
the screen; entering as its sound power level PWL, a value of
100 dB(A). Then
) inserting an receiver point near the right border of the screen.
) Calculating the level by clicking the calculator icon; recording the
noise level displayed on the edit dialog receiver point. (In our
example, this level was 44.1 dB(A)).

) When the dialog is closed, a new calculation must be given the same
level as the first one. This is not remarkable because only an Aweighted level of sound power has been entered for the source so far,
meaning its spectrum is not known.
) Now double-click the point source to open its edit dialog and select
Spectrum in the Type box. Even if nothing is entered, CadnaA now
assumes the specified form of the spectrum and thus identical levels
for each band of A-weighted spectrum. For the calculation, the spectrum is normalised to the sound power level entered before, i. e.,
100 dB(A).

A new calculation is now performed on the basis of the data entered with
frequency-dependent ground attenuation. Compare the values before and
after.
) Now enter in the Calculation|Configuration|Industry a ground
attenuation of G=0 for sound-reflecting ground - the calculation
results in a level higher than the first level.
Beside this global specification of the ground absorption, which refers to
the entire project, individual areas may be assigned specific absorption coefficients. Upon clicking the Ground Absorption icon on the toolbox, enter the borderlines of the area. The ground absorption is specified in the
edit dialog (opened by double-clicking on the borderline of the area). For
areas to which no such area has been assigned, the global settings as defined under Calculation|Configuration will apply.
Try, for example, to enter sound propagation conditions for a reflecting
water surface within a lawn area by entering G = 1 for the global calculation configuration, and G = 0 for the area of the water surface. With an appropriate calculation area, the grid calculation will yield the level
distribution as illustrated below.

10.2 General Information for Working with
Uneven Terrain in CadnaA
The contour of the terrain has two major effects on the calculation of
sound propagation.
1. It determines the heights of sources, shielding objects, and receiver
points, if the heights of these have been entered as relative values.
For short distances, this, in turn, may affect the length of the sound
path, thus the propagation loss, the path length difference around the
barrier, and, consequently, the insertion loss.
2. The average height of the sound ray, thus the ground attenuation, is
determined from the contour of the terrain.
Any program calculating immission must approximately calculate the
heights of the terrain from the input information available. Modelling the
terrain completely - using, e. g., an overall system of contour lines in fine
steps - is often ruled out because data is missing and would lead to a considerable increase in calculation times.
Therefore, the most effective method with regard to data input is to use
only as much detail in the height information as is needed, from the acoustic point of view, taking into account the two above-mentioned effects.
This is particularly true where data collection and input require time and,
consequently, expenses. It does not apply where existing data can be imported. In this case, it may become necessary to reduce the amount of data
by Simplifying the Geometry (see Chapter 5.7.11).
Being somewhat familiar with the program-internal procedures will help
you to determine the degree of detail needed and reasonable. Therefore,
we will give you a brief description of how contour-line information is
processed by CadnaA.
For each contour line and fault of line, the program internally generates a
barrier with this line as its top edge and which is perpendicular to the reference plane with an absolute height of 0.
10.2 Chapter 10 Topography
General Information for Working with Uneven Terrain in CadnaA

Where the height of an object has been given as a relative value, i. e., as
height above the ground, the program calculates, prior to the actual calculation of propagation , the absolute height of the terrain at the object base -
or the height of the terrain above the reference plane - for the polygon
points determining the object height. This is achieved by evaluating the information on the nearest contour lines.
This evaluation is done for
• the first point (corner entered first) of closed polygon lines defining
buildings
• each point entered for open polygon lines defining roads, and for general line sources, barriers, and similar objects
• each point entered for closed polygon lines defining parking lots, general area sources, and similar objects.
In the calculation of propagation, the sound ray from the source point to
the receiver point intersects the horizontal projections of all contour lines
and fault lines and any path length difference. Thus the shielding effect of
the elevated terrain is determined. Furthermore, the height of the sound
ray above the contour lines and fault lines at all intersections along with
the path lengths between these points serve to determine, by numerical integration, the average height of the sound ray, and from this value, the
ground attenuation. The heights of the terrain at source and receiver point,
determined, if necessary, from the contour lines near these points, are taken into account.
The procedures and program strategies described above lead to the following conclusions regarding correct data input.

10.3 Fit Objects to DTM1 or

CadnaA calculates the heights of objects and of the terrain at the pertinent
polygon points of the objects. For the area in-between, a linear interpolation is performed.
Therefore, the user may have to enter additional points where contour lines
and objects intersect to allow the change in slope of the terrain at such
points to be taken into account.
To evaluate the heights between contour lines with only a few polygon
points you can also insert additional polygon points for the contour lines
automatically in CadnaA. For that, you have two possibilities when executing the command: either directly at the object’s context menu, this would
affect only that object or its sourrounding terrain, or with the Modify Object command and the corresponding Action which would affect the desired objects which you have selected in the dialog (see Chapter 5.8):
1. Fit Objects to DTM. This command uses contour lines and edges of
triangulation to fit the object to the surface of the digital terrain
model.
2. Fit DTM to Object. This command changes the whole terrain model
by cutting existing contour lines and inserting new ones.

The z coordinate can be entered as a relative height, an absolute height, or
the height above the building roof. If a relative height is given, the absolute height z results from the height of the terrain at the position given by
the x and y coordinates of the point plus the relative height entered. If, for
a point, a definite height is to be achieved, it is convenient to enter an absolute height.

This option allows you to directly enter the height above the roof of a Roof 10.4
building in order to facilitate the specification of the height for external
sound sources on the roof of the building. If the source lies within the horizontal projection of the building, its height will be calculated as the sum
of the height of the building and the height above the roof specified here.
If different heights for polygon points are assigned to a building, the height
for that object will be calculated with the first height point of the building.
An area source, e.g., placed within the horizontal projection of a building
and whose height is assigned to the option "Roof" will have a uniform
height even if the heights of the polygon points are different. You may
have to input the height on each point directly by using the option "absolute height at every point".
In CadnaA buildings are modelled like "open boxes" without a roof. K0 10.4.0
Therefore K0 will be calculated according to the height above the digital

10.5 Contour Lines
Contour lines and fault lines serve to create a model of the topographical
conditions or of the contour of the terrain. They are entered with absolute
heights.
A contour line allocates to the terrain along these lines a defined height
above the reference plane. The height at any point of the line is specified
as generally described for line-like objects.
The contour of the terrain between the contour lines is interpolated for the
calculation, depending on the settings specified on the Calculation|Configuration|DMT tab.
The topographical conditions or uneven terrain may cause shielding effects and affect ground attenuation in the propagation calculation. Furthermore, the absolute height of objects whose height has been given as a
relative value is determined by taking into account the height of the terrain
at the base of the object as resulting from contour lines and fault lines.
For the calculation of the shielding effects of elevated terrain, contour
lines are treated like the top edges of barriers. Elevations generated by interpolation between the contour lines are not taken into account in this calculation.
The table Contour Lines (Tables menu) only lists the first and last points.
The listed heights are absolute values (see above).
The geometry data of the contour lines can be exported or printed by refering to the key word #(Table, Hline_GEO) .

10.6 Fault Lines
Contour lines and fault lines serve to create a model of topographical conditions or of the contour of a terrain.
A fault line is interpreted as a discontinuity in the terrain surface between
the heights of the terrain defined by the adjacent contour lines or the
heights applying directly to the terrain on both sides.
A fault line is defined by a line in the x-and-y plane. The fault lines table
(Tables menu) lists these lines with their automatically generated serial
numbers.
The geometry data of fault lines can be printed or exported using the key
word #(Table, Bruch_GEO) (see Chapter 17.4).
The height of the terrain near fault lines is interpolated arithmetically if the
option Determine Height from Contour Lines is active and is not easily
predictable in the individual case.

If a specific discontinuity is to be forced, it is always advisable to activate
the option Enter Height at Every Point and to directly assign the z values
to the left and right of the fault line by editing the coordinates table (see
Chapter 10.4).
For the calculation of the shielding effects caused by elevated terrain, fault
linesfault lines are treated like the top edges of barriers, with their heights
as determined by the contour line model.
Elevations generated by interpolation between contour lines and fault lines
are not taken into account in the calculation of the shielding effect.
fault lines are entered as line-like objects. Once the line has been inserted

10.7 Height Points
The topography, i.e., the geographical structure of the ground surface, can
be constructed with Contour Lines, Height Points and Fault lines. Note
that only lines, that means contour lines and fault lines, are considered
screening objects. Although the ground surface constructed with height
points is used to determine the height of objects with relative heights, it
does not influence the average height of a ray above ground (ground attenuation!) and is not taken into account as diffracting, except when the option Triangulation is activated. In this case the height points are
connected by additional lines and these are used in the screening calculation and for ground attenuation (see Chapter 12.4.6 "DTM Digital Terrain
Model Tab").
With the height points a defined height will be assigned to the ground
above the reference plane at the relevant location. This height will be defined generally as it was for Point Objects .
The shape of the ground between the height points will be interpolated in
the calculation according to the Calculation|Configuration.
The uneven surface of ground defined exclusively by height points is not
affected by screening. The absolute height of objects, for which a relative
height has been defined, is calculated according to the ground height resulting from the height point model at the base point of the object.
If Triangulation is not activated, no screening effect will be taken into account for uneven ground defined only by height points.
After inputting and double-clicking on the Height Point, the dialog opens,
containing edit boxes for the input of coordinates as is usual with point objects.

Delete Height Points 10.7 If the height point information for the digital terrain model is too detailed
you can delete them with the command Delete Height Points in Tables|Miscellaneous. After executing the command and entering a height,
the height points are deleted which deviate from each other less then the
defined height. By that, the height point model will be reduced accordingly.

10.7.1 Generate Contour Lines from Height Points
In contrast to contour lines height points usually have the disadvantage
that ground attenuation and shielding will not be taken into account in the
calculation of sound propagation (except if you have activated the DTM
Triangulation see Chapter 12.4.6).
To avoid this you can generate contour lines from the height points.
1. First define a grid in the menu Grid|Specification in which the
heights are to be calculated.
2. Click on the icon Show Ground Height.
3. Execute a grid calculation (Grid|Calc. Grid).
* For definition and representation of the lines of equal height the dialog boxes of the receiver point’s grid are used analogously. For the
representation of the lines of equal height use also the dialog of the
receiver point’s grid (Grid|Appearance). The lines of equal sound
power level are now lines of equal height. You can also use colour
settings in the menu Options.
In the menu Level Range (upper limit, lower limit, class width) you can
define - from which height (lower limit) to which height (upper limit) and
with which height differences (class width) - these lines shall be represented. If you quit the dialog with OK, you can see which contour lines will be
generated in the next step. Now press ALT+F12 - the represented lines of
equal height are now converted into the object type Contour Line.

10.8 Display Ground Height
At the individual points of a calculated grid (beside the sound level for day
and night) the ground height is also calculated and saved as a separate value from the contour lines, height points and fault lines as taken into account from the standard height defined in Calculation|Configuration if
necessary.
After the grid calculation beside the coordinates (x/y) and the sound level
(L), the ground height (G) will also be displayed in the status bar at the position of the mouse cursor.
* You do not need a sound source if you only calculate the ground
height.
Display Ground height10.8
If you click on the icon Display Ground Height neither the sound level
day nor night is shown longer, but the value of the ground height will be
activated and displayed on the screen equivalent to the settings made in
Grid|Appearence. The Lower and Upper Limit should now be entered,
and it should include all current ground height values.
If you activate Line of Equal Sound Level, the contour lines calculated
with interpolation will be displayed.
To look at the Day-time or Night-time levels you only have to click on the
relevant symbols.
* Hints for professionals: If you want to generate proper contour lines
in your project just press ALT+F12.

11.2 Receiver Points
A calculation of sound immission can be performed for a grid of points
(see Chapter 11.5) or for points specified individually after clicking the
Pocket Calculator in the icon bar. The icon shown above serves to insert
single receiver points at the desired position in the project.
As opposed to receiver points in a grid you can save all intermediate values for the individually placed receiver points (see chapter 12.6 Calculation Protocol).
Generate
Rays 11.2.0
You also can display the sound rays of the corresponding order of reflection (see Chapter 12.3). Therefore activate the option Generate Rays in
the edit dialog of the receiver point. The rays are deleted if you calculate
again with deactivated option Generate Rays.
Allocating a receiver
point to a building 11.2.0
To allocate a receiver point with the same distance to a building, you can
activate the Object Snap in the menu Options. The receiver points will
then be placed in front of the building at the defined distance from the facade. The default distance is 0,05 m. Therefore no receiver point disappears accidently inside the building.
To open the edit dialog Receiver Point click either with the RIGHT mouse
click (insertion mode) on the border of the receiver point or make a double-click (in the edit mode).

11.3 Designation of Land Use
Areas of different land use allow for the description of the designated land
use in accordance with the Land Use Ordinance. Points within such areas
can thus be assigned the standard levels for the different types of noise
(Options|Land Use). This feature allows you to adopt the types of designated land use for the entire CadnaA project directly from development
plans, and to calculate sensitivity maps. This leads to conflicting maps
where the differences between the rating levels calculated for each type of
noise and the standard levels, as per the designated land use, are calculated
(Prerequisite: XL module).
CadnaA can also automatically assign the pertinent standard levels to all
receiver points lying within a defined area of Land Use. The prerequisites
are
1. that the checkbox Determine from Areas of Land Use is activated
in the edit dialog of the receiver point and
2. an area of designated land use is inserted in which the receiver points
are included.
Enter the borderlines of the areas of designated land use after clicking the

11.5 Grid of Receiver Points
In the menu Grid you can specify a grid of points on which the immission Calc Grid 11.5.0
level is calculated and the result displayed as colored noise map with lines
or areas of equal sound levels. The calculation of the sound level for this
grid of points is started with the command Grid|Calc Grid (see Chapter
11.5.4).
With the command Grid|Save only the calculated grid will be saved, not Save Grid 11.5.0
the project file with the objects.
With the command Grid|Open you can load a calculated grid (noise map) Open Grid 11.5.0
only when it has been saved before either as a grid with the command
Grid|Save or from a CadnaA file which included a calculated grid. For
that, select the corresponding file in the dialog. With multiple selections
you are able to load several grids simultaneously into the current file.
Keep Current
Grid 11.5.0
If the Option Keep Current Grid is activated you can load grids in the
current file without deleting the existing ones. The first existing calculated
grid in the current file sets the mash of the grid. By different widths the
loaded grids will be adjusted to the first grid by interpolation.
This function enables the calculation of a big file with divided calculation
areas on different computers sharing the file by calculating only one of the
calculation areas one after the other. Afterwards all the grids will be loaded
together into the original file with Grid|Load and activated Option Keep
Current Grid.
A calculated grid can be deleted with the command Grid|Delete. The Delete Grid 11.5.0

If you wish to calculate an absolute grid height, activate the pertinent option. In this case, the grid does not follow the topography. Receiver points
lying in the ground are omitted.
A finer grid results in a higher density of receiver points. This enhances

those of the grids saved as R_B.CNA and RK_G.CNA.
As a test problem calculate the grid for a point source in front of a reflecting barrier and save it as R1. Now de-activate reflection and calculate the
energetic difference between r0 and the saved grid using the command sequence r1-- r0. The ISO-dB lines in the graphics illustrate the sound field

and then using this file to generate a grid of receiver points from these
lines. Of course you may also generate a DXF file (with activated option
Height is Level).
1. File|Import|Format: ArcView or DXF IsodB.dxf
In the Options dialog import the Iso-dB-lines as Contour Lines! Layername *. Deactivate the auxiliary polygons.
But of course this way only works if the values of sound levels are
integrated as height in the file of importation.
2. Subsequently calculate ground grid - Grid|Calc Grid - if necessary,
enter class width as well as upper and lower limit (When calculating only the ground grid, no source is needed - but first specify the
desired spacing of the receiver point grid in Grid|Specification).
3. Raster|Arithmetik - Expression for new grid: r0g
That's it. This has turned the ground grid to a grid which you can save for
further use (Grid|Save ).
If necessary do not forget to delete the contour lines.
But what is happened, if the value of sound level is only integrated as textual information, e.g., like an entry in the ID box after the file has been imported as contour line?

We will not discuss the accumulation of data any further here, but we

Noise Maps 11.6.1 The complete data of the project - this is valid for our built-up area as well
as for a big city - is contained in a single file which can be opened with a
double-click on its file name. Anyone who has already suffered under other programs with its numberless run files, command files and the modules
which have to be loaded one after the other will very much appreciate this.
On the basis of the mighty group concept of CadnaA it is easily possible
to calculate noise maps consecutively for road traffic and/or railways, for
industry and trade plants, for sport and leisures facilities, for aircraft noise
and for any other source of noise. For that, it is only necessary that each
source is allocated a noise type with at least one character in its ID code.
If, for example, the ID codes of all roads contain the characters S30 as
first digits, then all roads will be deactivated for a calculation with the following entry in the edit dialog Group.
Test this with the
example file

If all noise sources are deactivated - except those which have to be calculated - you can start the calculation (Grid|Calc Grid) with the desired settings made in Calculation|Configuration.
In our example for the built-up area with the through-road it has been calculated in a 10 m grid. Switch on the option Raster, Oversampling 1 in
Grid|Appearance.

In CadnaA the areas of diverse land use can be allocated different permitted or standard values for the individual noise types. Therefore you have to
draw a closed polygon (with the icon Area of Designated Land use from
the toolbox) around a region which you can allocate a certain usage. After
double-click on this polygon you can enter the pertinent ranking of land
use.

In the edit dialog Land Use the density of inhabitants (population/km²)
can also be entered. This value is required if, e.g., an evaluation is to be
carried out according to a noise impact value. The population density can
determined, also automatically, by counting the buildings in this area with
CadnaA.
Digital Zoning Plan /

The mentioned land uses result from the zoning plan, urban land use planning or the legally binding land use plan or by consideration of the actual

Conflict Maps
Manual

11.6.2 Conflict Maps
A conflict occurs where the relevant maximum receiver value has been exceeded. In the same way as the actual noise impact is illustrated as a level
in the noise map, the conflict maps can depict the degree of excess and deviation from the relevant standard receiver value in a coloured map.
Prior to the calculation of the conflict map the file with the noise map
should be saved (File|Save As).
After the areas of designated land use (see Chapter 11.3) have been specified, the conflict maps can be calculated because CadnaA then knows the
relevant maximum sound levels at the receiver points for each type of
noise.
) To this end, select from the list the type of noise which was used to XL_01.cna
calculate the current noise map on the dialog opening. In our example
we only have calculated the traffic noise.
In the calculation, the standard receiver values specified for this type of
noise will be considered for any type of land use. (They are specified under Options|Land Use - see Chapter 11.4.)
As a rule, the coloured representation of the map disappears upon comple- Konflikt.pal
tion of the calculation, because the palette was not matched to the differences in level occurring in the conflict map. It is therefore convenient to
generate a specific palette for maps of conflicts under Grid|Appearance|Options, and to save it as conflict.pal. A negative value for the lower
limit of the representation range should also be selected here.

11.6.3 Evaluation
Although the conflict maps (see Chapter 11.6.2) neatly illustrate problem
areas, this information is still far too detailed for an evaluation of different
planning alternatives. An unambiguous scaling in terms of a singlenumber rating is required here.
There are numerous ways for such a single-number rating. Presently, however, there is no generally accepted and standardised algorithm. As the
purpose is to quantify the noise impact on a complete area, all these concepts agree in raising the noise impact quantity with an increasing number
of persons concerned and with increasing sound level or increasing excess
level. The number of persons concerned, N, is generally considered as a
linear influence. The influence of the level, however, is a matter of controversy. An exponential term is certainly appropriate since the effect of an
increase in level by x dB is the more detrimental the higher the original
level, or the excess level, is.
In order to accommodate different concepts and to remain open to future
developments the evaluation formula may be specified arbitrarily by the
user. The following example illustrates the simplest possible concept, i. e.,
adding the excess levels per inhabitant for the entire area.

LB Noise impact value
Ni Number of persons subject to excess level Üi
Üi Excess level in dB
LB N Ü i i = × ∑

Such an evaluation can only be carried out for an area, if
• the calculated noise map is available in CadnaA and
• all areas to be considered in the evaluation are assigned a designated
land use, and thereby a standard receiver value.
Then, under Grid|Evaluation, open the dialog and - as a simple test - enter the characters fl in the field Expression. This entry fl causes the
addition of all grid surfaces which results in the total area.
Since fl shows the area in m² of each grid point when scanning them all,
and consequently, adding up these areas, clicking Calculate will yield the
total area covered by the grid. For a noise map the entry shown in the following dialog may appear as an example. The total area here is approximately 2.3 km² .

11.6.4 Population Density
The density of inhabitants for a certain area or the numbers of residents
per building will be required if an evaluation like the noise impact value is
to be performed.
Either we have these numbers and enter them via keyboard and import or
we evaluate and enter them. This estimation can, however, be a laborious
job. CadnaA can settle this automatically in an effective way.
The following is required to calculate the density of inhabitants/km²:
• areas of designated land use (see Chapter 11.3) have to be inserted
• in these areas buildings (see Chapter 9.3.2) are included and
• a formula (see Chapter 2.6) has to be entered for the calculation of
inhabitants.
* We do not need areas of designated land uses if we calculate only the
residents of buildings.
With Grid|Population Density we open a dialog for entering a formula
with the variables indicated in the dialog for the calculation of the inhabitants.
In the above figure we have presupposed that in each case, on average,
40 m² of floor space can be allocated to one person and that the floor
height is on average 3 m.

With the command in the menu Tables|Miscellanous|Close Buildings
you are able to connect individual polygon lines to a closed polygon and to
represent them as the object Building. This is helpful if you have to import
buildings in CadnaA with files from a third-party program (like AutoCad
DXF file), buildings which are drawn with individual lines instead of with
closed polygons.
Initial situation: An imported DXF file where buildings
are drawn with individual lines. Those have to be imported first as the object Auxiliary Polygon. Then the lines
have to be connected to a closed polygon and are automatically converted to buildings afterwards.

In the following example each building, with a symbol of Building Evaluation, is assigned to a representative sound power level..
Furthermore for each building is the population known.
Es soll nun für jedes Gebäude eine von Bewohnerzahl n und Haus-Schallpegel L abhängige Lärmbelastungsgröße ermittelt werden nach
The amount of the noise impact shall now be evaluated for each building.
This is dependent on the number of residents n and the sound level L of the
buildings.

This impact measure shall be added for the whole area and a coloured map

1000 m² in each case.
The Object-Scan achieves this with the following dialog:
The Formula for Summantion correspond to the above term.
SmallCity02.cna In this example the population is assigned to the individual buildings.
Zur Darstellung in einer Farbkarte könnten die Häuser entsprechend der

100m x 100m gemittelte Einwohnerdichte als Einwohner/100m² als Farbkarte dargestellt werden.
On a coloured map the buildings could be coloured equivalent to the population but cannot be optically distinguished when they are displayed in a
big scale. For that reason the population density shall be averaged over a

larger area of 100 m x 100 m and displayed as a coloured map with population/100 m².
Open the dialog Grid|Object-Scan as shown in the following:
Select in the first box for Object Type Building because the evaluation
shall refer to the population in buildings
The variable prop supplies for each building inside the Window the value 1 and for buildings on the border of the Window a value from 0 to 1
which specifies the part of the building area located inside the Window.
With the product prop*einw therefore the population which has been alloted to the specified square is added. The result is saved in the variables
sumt for the day and sumn for the night (the bulding attribute „population“ is for day and night equal).
In the example the area of the specified Window and therefore 100 m x
100 m = 10000 m², is divided by the area_w and multiplied by 100. The
division leads to the population per m² and the multiplication to the population per 100 m².

11.6.7 Monetary Evaluation of Noise according
to BUWAL
* The CadnaA Option XL is required for the evaluation!
A technique to evaluate the noise is described in the study /54/. This me- The method
thod has been integrated into CadnaA.
This method takes into account the reduction in value of rented flats that
results from high noise levels. This is done by converting the noise load of
residential areas into amounts of money. If the value of a noise reduction
measure is to be evaluated, then this is done by calculating the noise distribution with and without this measure. The difference in the two amounts
of money is represented by the reduced value according to the noise expressed in value of the measure.
The philosophy behind this technique shall not be discussed in detail here.
It shall only be mentioned that this method of evaluating and assessing the
noise is conservative and tends to underestimate the negative aspects of
noise. The use of the influence of the noise on the rent prices of residential
areas doesn't take into consideration many other negative consequences,
like the long term health of the population and the development of a city.
But nevertheless this technique is a pragmatic and transparent way of assessing cost-benefit relations when noise is evaluated. And this is always
positive.

Monetary Data
(local)
The edit dialog of the RA-residential area shows (see chapter 11.3) that
when "Monetary Data" is activated three further values can be entered
• Floor/Ground Ratio (NAGFZ)
• Rental/m²/a (NAMIETE)
• Rental abatement (NAMIND)
The bracketed abbreviations are the names of variables needed later to perform necessary operations.
In the edit fields for rental abatement in the dialog Area of designated
Land Use the two variables
• LP sound pressure level
• NA_STR maximum value for noise from road traffic (defined in Options|Land Use|Limiting Value)
are used to express the loss in value for all areas with sound levels within
5 dB under the maximum value.
The floor/ground ratio is a factor that that, when multiplied by the
ground area, gives the maximal residential area of buildings permitted on
this area. Rental/m²/a: can be entered in any currency unit. The calculated
results are then related to this currency.
The factor in the equation of input line Rental Abatement - 0.01 in the
first example - is the loss of rent due to a level increase of 1 dB. 0.01, meaning rentals are reduced by 1% if the level raises 1 dB.
Further variables needed in the expressions of evaluation :
• Area of a grid element in m² (FL)
• Logical value (0-false, 1-true) as a definition if a grid element is inside
an area of designated land-use or not (NAOK)

Calc Grid In the first step, to come to a monetary evaluation of the noise, the noise
level is calculated on a grid for the whole area.
Evaluate Grid With the second step the evaluation, with the defined formula in
Grid|Evaluation, is calculated for all grid points and the result is added
up.
The following results are obtained when using the expressions on the right
side. The accuracy depends on the size of the grid elements because a grid
element is taken to be in an area if the grid point is located in it. It is therefore recommended you use grid spacings as small as possible.
FL Calculation area in m²
FL*NAOK Area of designated land use in m²
FL*NAOK*NAGFZ Total residential area in an area of
designated land use
FL*NAOK*NAGFZ*NAMIETE Rental for all areas of
designated land use
FL*NAOK*NAGFZ*NAMIETE*NAMIND
Reduction in rent caused by noise
With example 1:
• the calculation area (FL) is 10080 m².
• The size of the area of designated land use is 8000 m².
• The floor/ground ratio is 0.8.
So the maximal residential area on this estate is 0.8 x 8000 m² = 6400 m².
The rental with 100 € per year and m² is therefore 640.000 €.

Evaluation example 1--
loss in value based on
residential areas 11.6.7
The three above mentioned values floor/ground ratio, rental/m²/a and
rental abatement have been entered in the edit dialog of this area - the values are therefore only valid for this individual area (local). It is also possible to enter these values in Options|Land use for each type of general
land use (global) - in this case they are valid for all areas of this type. If the
values have been entered globally and locally, the local values for an area
dominate. Globally defined values are used for all areas of this type where
no local ones exists.

Step 2 -
Evaluation 11.6.7
After noise levels have been calculated on the specified grid, the evaluation in the form of a reduction in value is carried out in Grid|Evaluation.
The example file Monetary1.cna just includes the correct expressions.
Monetary1.cna The expression for calculating the annual reduction in rent resulting from
noise is
FL*NAOK*NAGFZ*NAMIETE*NAMIND
After a click on Calculate the reduction in rent of 60416 € caused by the
noise is shown.
Changing the number of cars (MDTD) to 10000 cars/24h, recalculating
and evaluating with the described steps shows a reduction in this noise induced loss to 40789 €. With the same technique all possible measures like
screens and barriers or reorganisation of traffic flows can easily be evaluated and ranked.

Evaluation example 2a - loss in value based on residential premises as single digit value
With example 1 the residential area was calculated from the whole area
and the floor/ground ratio was the basis for the evaluation. This meant that
the probability of people living at any certain position in this area was regarded to be the same for all positions.
It is also possible to use the exact position of all buildings and their geometric location - this gives a result that is more accurate because the screened and therefore quieter facades reduce the building’s noise level and
lead to a better result for well designed buildings and residential areas.
Example 2 uses this technique. With example 2a the noise induced loss of
value for all buildings is calculated as a single number value. This is the
best procedure if different strategies for noise reduction are to be ranked.
The following diagram shows example 2, a scenario with roads, buildings Monetary2.cna
and areas of designated land-use. The above mentioned values are defined
globally (Options|Land use).

In Options|Building noise map select energetic for the Averaging Method (see chapter 9.3.6).
 Scenario with buildings, roads and areas of designated land use
(and symbols for building evaluation)
The building evaluation symbols have been attached to all buildings automatically using the Modify Object command. Then the calculation for defined receiver points is started (this includes calculation of façade levels
and building evaluation.
Step 2 -
Evaluation as single digit
result using
Object-Scan 11.6.7
Evaluation is carried out using the command Grid|Object-Scan (see
chapter 11.6.6). The parameters and expressions that should be used for
this type of evaluation are shown in the following window. Leaving this
window with OK, the single digit result is calculated taking into account
the façade levels of all 97 buildings.

12.2 Sound Rays and Reflection
CadnaA enables the calculation of sound propagation according to standardized procedures (calculation according to standards like CRN, CRTN,
ISO 9613 etc.) and with settings that are defined by the user.
This chapter deals with the second task and its possibilities with CadnaA
and is therefore more concerned with the pysical aspects of sound propagation. This is very important for us because CadnaA is used increasingly
for expert work, in scientific work at universities and in lectures. Although
the professional usage requires a strict application of the pre-determined
guidelines and standards it can be very helpful in correctly processing special problem-orientated cases which are not covered by the regulations.
This especially concerns the treatment of reflections of a higher order.
With the above regulations a reflection of the first order is only dealt with
according to the mirror image method and therefore the reflection of a ray
at one acoustically even surface.
The contribution of more orders of reflections to the total result, e.g., at the
building facades on both sides of a closed built-up road, will be taken into
account by calculating analytically a correction for multiple reflections
from the geometrical and acoustic parameters.
This strategy fails if the geometries of the road built-up at both sides is
completely different and varies from building to building. The same problem exists with the noise level in backyards - it must be calculated taking
into account high order reflections.
CadnaA is able to calculate reflections completely up to higher order. It is
clear that this increases calculation times, because the number of rays
grow exponentially with this reflection order. With the possibility to show
all these calculated rays at the screen, CadnaA is a very helpful tool in
learning and teching about sound propagation.
Chapter 12.3 explains how paths of rays can be displayed. Because of the
selective display possibilities for the different orders (by using groups), the
handling might look a bit complicated, but it is an excellent tool for clari-

fying the executed calculation and therefore can be helpful in a technical
report in many cases. We recommend that the detailed examples be understood step by step. Once you have taken this initial hurdle the inclusion of
ray representations in drawings and text documents is easily possible.

12.2.1 Sound Rays from Point Sources
In a physical sense a wave field goes out from a source Q which transports
the sound power in all directions via the movement of the air particles. Because the surface of the spheres’ hull expands with increasing distance,
and the sound power is distributed over the hull over a certain period of
time, the sound intensity decreases and therefore the sound pressure level,
too. With increasing distance source - receiver it becomes quieter.
Sound propagation from Source Q to Reciver Point RP physical (left) and numerical (right)
If CadnaA calculates, the distance between source Q and receiver RP will
be determined and, with the sound power level of the source, the sound
pressure level at the receiver point will be calculated with analytical formulas which have been derived from the physical model. The wave field is
in a certain way replaced by one ray from source to receiver.

If there are many sources there are also many sound rays which have to be
considered in the calculation. For all receivers affecting sound rays the calculated proportion of the level will be added energetically.

12.2.2 Sound Rays from extended Sources
such as Line and Area Sources
Even in the case of calculating the noise level from an extended source as
the area source shown in fig. A, a distance has to be found that can be used
in the equation of propagation. This may be wrong if the pivot of the extended source is used as starting point of the ray. Since, actually, each arbitrary portion of the area source emits sound, the same value of a level
must result if the total stripe according to figure B is to be subdivided and
the sound pressure level at the receiver point is calculated as the sum of the
levels of the 5 contributions from the partial sources FQ1 till FQ5.
However, the partial sources, according to figure B, result in different partial levels because of the different distances. On the basis of the energetic
addition a higher sound pressure level results from fig. B than from taking
into account only one ray emitted from the pivot as shown in fig. A.
This error has been avoided in CadnaA by partitioning each extended line
or area source in sufficiently small parts for automatic calculation.
But these partial areas do not have the same size as shown in figure B.
They become even smaller the closer the corresponding section of the extended source is to the receiver.

This dynamic division, which must newly be calculated for each receiver,

12.2.3 The Projection Method for
extended Sound Sources
The automatic division of an extended sound source into smaller partial areas depending on the distance of the receiver (see Chapter 12.2.2 "Sound
Rays from extended Sources such as Line and Area Sources") is not sufficient to avoid errors in the calculation of sound pressure levels.
Figure 1: Calculation of the area source „soccer field“ with two sound rays
Let us take the example of a soccer field as in the upper figure. For a noise
calculation at the remote receiver point IP CadnaA would split the soccer
field into two partial areas and would therefore take into account two
sound rays. This is correct for the shown situation.

Now a shielding club house with a height of 8 m is located in the position
shown in the following figure.
Figure 2: Soccer field with partially shielding club house
In the calculation of both displayed sound rays, screening and therefore a
lower sound pressure level occurs in each case. But, in fact, not all partial
areas, which are included in the calculation with the paths of the two rays,
are shielded by the building. The resulting sound pressure level would be
too low in the present example.
CadnaA avoids this error by using a projection method.
With that, in the first step the area sources will be divided into shielded
and non-shielded areas and in the second step subdivided according to the
relation of area size to receiver distance. In this way, in the present example, 12 partial areas are created: altogether, nevertheless, because of the
large distance from the receiver (340 m), 8 areas are not shielded and 4 areas are shielded.

jects between receiver and road. Then a subdivision occurs according to
the distance criteria.
Figure 3 c: Projection method for reflecting sound parts
Much more complicated are the relations in the projection of the reflecting
sound parts dealt with in the next chapter. Figure 3 c shows the construction of both sections for the axis of the outer road lanes which are necessary because of the reflecting building. The same method - graphically
hardly to explain - will also be applied by CadnaA for the multiple reflections dealt with futher on.
Although the projection method naturally extends the calculation considerably it should always be switched on for a detailed calculation like
„acoustical zoom“. After all, even in the simple situation figure 3a, 12
paths of rays instead of 2 must be calculated.

12.2.4 Reflection
Additional sound rays appear in the sector of the path of sound propagation from reflective objects which affect the receiver and could increase
the sound level.
The mirror-source method will be applied regularly by the calculation of
reflection and it is therefore assumed that the reflective areas are „acoustically even“. In the experience of engineering the numerical calculation of
diffuse reflection has only been achieved over the statistical approach for
the density of scattering objects (see e.g. /31/). A numerically correct resolution for point-precise calculation with diffuse reflection is dealt with in /
32/. But this is still a lavish resolution for the professional practice.
On the other hand the mirror-source method has been proved excellent for
the propagation of sound, also in cases strictly without even areas. The
propagation of sound including reflection up to an extremly high order has
been described precisely (see to this /33/ and /11/) for industry halls in
which the surfaces areas are anything but even (through extensions such as
pipelines and so on).

12.2.5 Reflection of the 1st Order
You are required to calculate the reflection of the first order if such a reflection contributes to the sound level at the receiver according to the
guidelines RLS90 /8/, Schall03 /7/ and ISO 9613-2 /20/.
The calculation occurs in three steps which have to be carried out for each
reflective area according to each Q-IP pair.
1. Step: Constructing the position of the mirror sources
2. Step: Sectioning the connecting line of the reflected source - receiver
point with an area and determining the breakhrough-point.
3. Step: Calculating the part of the sound level according to the longer
path of the ray over the reflecting area including the absorption
coefficient of this area.
In the example shown below two parts of sound level are taken into account at the receiver (IP) which are calculated from the displayed paths of
rays.
Figure A: The paths of rays with the reflection of the first order
12.2.5 Chapter 12.2 Sound Rays and Reflection
Reflection of the 1st Order
Manual

12
Important for the correct calculation of reflection, according to the mentioned guidelines, is that all reflections of the first order be checked and, if
necessary, be included in the calculation. That is not obvious - software
programs exist which check, starting at the receiver, a ray only till the first
reflector crosses the path of the ray in the plan, even if this reflector is not
affecting anything because of the low height and the area lying behind
which reflects the ray. The calculation of reflection must, as in the example of picture A, also find a level-raising contribution if, as in picture B, a
low obstacle at the base seems to block the ray’s path.
Figure B: The paths of rays for the reflection of the first
order with obstacles in the path of the ray.
A typical example of this case is shown in figure C. The program only investigates up to the first reflector which is found, then at the house on the
left side of the road the amount of reflection which is caused by the high
building is not taken into account only because a 1 m high wall is located
between this high building and the four lane road. This calculation is not in
accordance with RLS90 in this case.
Besites this, CadnaA takes into account reflections if screening objects
obstruct the path of the reflected sound ray. The part of the sound level
which was caused by the reflecting sound at the receiver point is then reQ

duced by the value which results from the screening calculation for the
path: mirror-source - receiver.
Figure C: For the calculation of the sound level at the left residential building, according to
RLS90, the reflection of the traffic noise on the high right building has to be calculated despite the low wall between the road and the building.
CadnaA also calculates the reflection for extended sources such as line or
area sources, but these objects will be split into sufficiently small partial
sources. Figure D shows the already familiar soccer field with three buildings located in the neighbourhood and the paths of rays taken into account.

12.2.6 Reflections of Higher Order
In calculating reflections of second order all valid mirror-sources have to
be reflected again on all reflecting areas to prove the validity of each reflection and to calculate the corresponding path of the ray.
The number of rays with a further order of reflection results from the product of the number of reflections from the last order multiplied by the
number of valid reflectors. The specification of this numeric method is
found in /32/.
It is obvious that the number of possible reflections explodes with an increasing number of orders. Calculations up to higher orders are only completely possible for very restricted arrangements. On the other hand, a
reflection has to be calculated first before its contribution can be evaluated
as irrelevant.
CadnaA enables the calculation of reflections of high orders for all type of
sources. The paths of ray can be displayed and the sound level contributions of the reflections are separately identified. According to the specifications of the standards for the source type Road and Railway with
activating these standards only reflection of first order are calculated using
mirror-image method - reflections of higher order are taken into account
with a penalty for multiple reflections.
An example for the complete calculation of reflection up to the 10. order is
shown with the backyard in figure A. A point source located in front of
the opening beams into the backyard, and the sound level shall be calculated at the represented receiver IP.

Abitrary arrangements of objects can be taken into account for a calculation of reflections. With this technique it is possible to perform the calculation of the sound level corresponding to the reality in cases not
corresponding to the valid guidelines.

If Generate Rays is activated in the edit dialog of a receiver point all calculated rays with this target point are inserted as auxiliary plygon lines.
With double-click on such a ray its contribution to the sound level at the
receiver is indicated. This sound contribution is shown in the field ID with
its proportionate level, e.g., RAY_419_00 which signifies that the direct
sound ray (_00) contributes 41.9 dB.
The rays are shown on screen as if they cross screening objects straightly -
nevertheless screening is calculated taking into account vertical and lateral
diffraction. In this case an s will be attached in their identifier. A shielded
ray of the eighth order for which a calculation of diffraction has been enforced may have an identifier RAY_419_08s.
On this base, rays with a certain order of reflection can be displayed or
switched off easily in CadnaA with the efficient group function
(Tables|Groups see Chapter 18.2 "Groups"). If the rays are displayed, all
diffracted sound rays can be switched off in the representation by deactivating the group with the expression *_??s.
With corresponding settings for all deactivated objects in Options|Apperance (see Chapter 13.6 "Object Appearance") you can enforce the diffracted and non-contributed, mostly irrelevant rays to disappear

In developing CadnaA, it was, and continues to be, our goal to give the
professional user the desired freedom of choice and control while relieving
those only interested in overall results from having to master all the available options. This complexity and flexibility of CadnaA is particularly evident when large stocks of data have been entered which are then to be
processed under the Calculation|Configuration menu.
The Calculation Configuration dialog serves to specify all settings required for the calculation, and, quite conveniently, to save these settings
with the calculated project file.
There are various tabs for groups of options within this dialog. Click the
tab for the desired group to specify and select the options.
By way of example, the tabs are described here for application of the German guidelines. They apply accordingly to those of other countries.

max. Error
(dB) 12.4.3
Sound sources, whose contribution to the sound immission at the receiver
point is negligible, will be disregarded in the calculation if the overall error
induced by this simplification is not larger than the defined value. Therefore, the larger the maximum permissible error in the final result, the
shorter the time required for the calculation.
For expertise work and not very large projects the setting 0 should be chosen. If noise maps of cities are calculated a value of 0.5 or 1 should be a
good compromise.
max. Search
Radius (m) 12.4.3
The search radius defines a circle around the receiver point. Only sound

Total Level 12.4.3 The Total Level command line allows you to calculate the level distribution of an arbitrary arithmetic or energetic combination of the level distributions resulting from the individual types of sources. This option has not
been activated in the default settings. Therefore, CadnaA calculates the
energetic sum of all groups of sources at the receiver points. If variants of
the aforementioned kind are to be calculated, activate the Total Level option and adapt the equation accordingly.
If the option Total Level is not activated the following calculation is executed:
Standard
Calculation
Total Level = ind++str++sch
* But pay attention! With the activated option CadnaA always calculates all sources - independent of the entered formula - but displays
the total result only according to the user defined formula. In the calculation of a single receiver point the contribution of all activated
sources are also included in the partial levels.
To avoid this, deactivate the sources you do not want to be calculated
before you start the calculation.

The subsequent grid calculation yields the energetic sum of noise from
road traffic and railbound traffic, where the level of railbound traffic does
not include the bonus of 5 dB.

Standard
Deviation
To take the uncertainty into account you have to enter a Standard Deviation sigma in dB in the Memo Window (see Chapter 5.5.3) of all noise
sources. If the sound power level of the source has been measured, this is
the standard deviation of reproducibility according to grade 1, 2 or 3 (see
ISO 3740 series)

After confirming the dialog with OK and executing the calculation with
Grid|Calc Grid (see Chapter 11.5) you get the distribution of uncertainty.
You don’t need to activate the option Total Level if you only want to calculate the uncertainty at individually inserted receiver points (see Chapter
11.5). This is always calculated automatically.
You can display the sigma either in the Result Table (see Chapter 15.3)

In addition to the uncertainty of the emission levels you also can take into

For the time being a standard deviation óD for the attenuation D which depends on the distance is taken into account by CadnaA with the following
formula
where k can be defined by the user, d is the distance source – receiver and
d0 is a reference distance of 10 m. Based on experience a value of K = 3
maybe used.

Extrapolate Grid Under

Selecting this option will generate "seamless" transitions from the horizontal projection of an object to coloured areas and lines of equal sound
levels regardless of the calculation grid selected. This is achieved by interpolation of the levels calculated for the grid points (see also chapter 11.5.2
Appearance of Grid).
We recommend, however, that you deactivate this option before the calculation if lines of equal sound level are to be displayed with the option Exclude Grid under Buildings active (see Chapter 11.5.1 paragraph
"Exclude Sound Sources/ Buildings").
Grid
interpolation 12.4.3
If this option with the settings n*n is selected, then a calculation is made at
each of these (n+1) points of the specified grid points (Grid|Specification), in the first step only and at the pivot of every rectangle, limited by
4 points.
If one of the following conditions is not fulfilled for one of the 4 edge
points and the center point of a n*n arrangement of grid points then this
rectangle is subdivided into 4 equal quadrangles and, for each quadrangle,
the same test is again performed. If one of these conditions is still exceeded, then a further subdivision recursively occurs until the conditions are
fulfilled or all points, in accordance with the grid specification, are taken
into account in the calculation.
The conditions are: Conditions:
1. The mean level calculated from the levels at the 4 edge points should
not differ from the level at the center point more than the specified
maximum deviation (default setting 0.1 dB). This must be fulfilled
for both diagonal lines.
2. The difference between the largest and the smallest calculated level
at the 4 corner points of the rectangle is, at most, equal to the specified maximum value (default setting 10 dB).
If these conditions are fulfilled, then the interpolated values match the real
values inside the rectangle sufficiently and the levels at the remaining

1. that you enter in Calculation|Configuration Reflection Tab the
maximum order of reflection you want to take into account and
2. that the objects’ settings (buildings, barriers, cylinders), which have
to be included into a calculation with reflection, are adjusted for
reflection.
Although CadnaA calculates reflection with an extremly fast algorithm,
the number of essential steps of calculation explodes with an expanding
number of order and with the amount of reflecting surfaces. A calculation
with an order of reflection higher than 1 should therefore always be applied to well defined scenarios with few objects. For such special investigations a corresponding small part from the total scenario of the project

max. Order of
Reflection 12.4.7
The maximum order of reflections, which are taken into account as mirror
image sources, strongly influences the calculation time. In most cases, taking into account first-order reflections is sufficient. Considering the calculation times, it is recommended you use higher orders of reflection only for
limited scenarios containing few objects.
For calculations of road traffic noise according to RLS 90 /8/ and railway
noise according to Schall03 /7/, first-order reflections shall be considered
exclusively. Therefore, if values ≥ 1 are entered, the user input is ignored,
provided that the options Strictly according to RLS-90 (see Chapter

If the field is empty or the value 0 is entered, no reflecting areas will be

Object 12.4.7
If, for the calculation of the sound level in front of a window, a receiver
point is placed in front of the building wall, the reflection from the building itself must not be taken into account in the determination of the characteristic immission level.
It is therefore recommended you enter approximately 0.5 m or 1 m. In accordance with the guidelines, no reflections are then calculated for those
immission points which have been assigned to the building by means of
the Object Snap (see Chapter 13.5).
Interpolate

You should enter approximately 0.5 m if the increase in radiation in the

accounted for by assigning a global directivity index K0. This reduces calculation time without preventing the calculation of reflections for other
sources (see chapter 8.6.8 Ko without Ground).

The settings made on the Industry tab have an effect on the following
sources:
• the general point, line, and area sources, vertical and horizontal (see
chapter 8.3, 8.4, 8.5)
• optimisable area source (see chapter 8.15)
• parking lot according to VDI (see chapter 8.13))
• tennis point of service (see chapter 8.8)
Lateral
Diffraction 12.4.8
Three options for lateral diffraction are available for selection:
• non-lateral diffraction
• only one object - lateral diffraction is not calculated if more than one
object intersects the line connecting the source to the immission point.
• some objects - the two shortest possible convex rays around the
arrangement are determined and taken as a basis for the calculation.

Under Only up to Distance (m), enter the distance between source and receiver point for which lateral diffraction is to be taken into account.
No neg. path difference12.4.8 With activated option by ISO 9613-2 no barrier attenuation is calculated if
the ray from the source to the receiver is above the upper edge of the barrier.
Ground
Attenuation 12.4.8
For taking into account the ground attenuation you may choose the following options:
Exclude Ground Attenuation over Barrier 12.4.8
No ground attenuation will be taken into account for shielded sound rays
according to VDI 2720 equation (5) De = Dz - DBM,0 ≥ 0 dB or ISO
9613-2 equation (12).
Include Ground Attenuation over Barrier 12.4.8
The ground attenuation is calculated for a sound ray diffracted over an object, taking into account the change in the average height above the ground
of the sound ray passing over the barrier according to VDI 2720, equation
(2) De = Dz - D0 + Dm ≥ 0 dB
10m-Criterion 12.4.8 If a source is more than 10 m above ground and at least one edge of the
barrier is more than 10 m above the ground then it is calculated according
to VDI 2720 equation (6) De = Dz or ISO 9613-2, annotation 15 equation
(13) will be taken into account.
No sub. of neg. Ground
Att. 12.4.8
With this option activated, negative ground attenuation is not subtracted
from screening attenuation (according to ISO 9613-2 equation (12)). So
the effect of reflecting ground is not distroyed by barriers.
Ground
Attenuation
spectral 12.4.8
Spectral ground attenuation according to ISO 9613-2 is only calculated if
1. the noise source is calculated spectrally and
2. the option Ground Attenuation spectrally is activated.

1. then the noise source must be calculated with a single band and
2. regardless whether Ground Attenuation spectral is active or not for
this noise source the ground attenuation is not calculated spectrally in
any case.
Ground
absorption G: 12.4.8
If you want to change the value of the ground attenuation G: (default 1)
you have to activate (check mark) the option Ground Attenuation spectral.
* Hint for the calculation according to ÖAL: The ground absorption is ÖAL
always calculated by the selected country setting Austria regardless
whether this option is activated or not.

Insertion
Loss 12.4.8
For the insertion loss you may choose the following options:
• Dz without limit
• Dz with limit
• De,o with limit
According to ISO 9613-2 and VDI 2720 the insertion loss caused by barriers and screens is, at most, 20 dB if a single - and 25 dB if more than one -
screening edge is crossed by the ray (the latter is also the case with one
thick barrier). With the option Abar /Dz without limit activated in menu
Calculation|Configuration|Tab Industry the barrier equations of this
guideline are used for any height without this limitation.
The insertion loss De,o with a limit is a former option in CadnaA (in order
to prevent alterations with older projects).
Obstacles within
Area Source do not
Shield 12.4.8
When this option is active, any obstacle, such as buildings, foliage, barriers etc., lying within area sources, including parking lots and optimisable
area sources, are ignored.

this can be taken into account with the parameter Transparency in the edit
dialog of the object Building (see Chapter 9.3.1).
Chimneys/stacks: This option is important if the radiation from the upper 950_21_Chimney.pdf
chimney opening is modelled by locating a point-, line- or area source. In
this case the cylinder, which may be necessary to reflect and shield noise
from sources outside, does not falsify the chimney’s directivity by additional screening. In this case the point source should be positioned at a
height a little bit lower than the chimney height (otherwise the cylinder reacts again as a screening object). With the same option it is possible to
simulate the emission of a thick tube, which shall be taken into account as
a screening object for sources and immission points at opposite sides, by a
line source positioned in it's axis /56/.

Austria 12.4.10
If Austria is chosen in menu Calculation|Configuration|Tab Country
(Selection box Country) the standard ÖNORM S 5011 /24/ is used as the
default for the calculation of noise from railroads.
Source Height 0,5 m (for
Ground Attenuation)
With this option activated, the height of the ground at the position of the
source, which is used to calculate the attenuation by absorption of the
ground, is assumed to be 0.5 m less than the z-coordinate of the source.
This is a requirement of the standard ÖNORM S 5011.
If it is not activated, the height of the ground is derived from the topografic
model defined by contour lines, but a minimal distance of 0.5 m between
source and ground is assumed. With this last condition the noise from a
railway in a cut can be calculated correctly without the necessity to designing the bottom of the cut with contour lines. In this case the outer diffracting edges of the cut are modelled by two contour lines and the zcoordinate of the railway track is defined with the correct lower value. The
bottom of the cut is then assumed to be 0.5 m below the source.

defined Areas 12.5.0
After clicking this toolbox icon, you insert a closed polygon around the
area for which you want to calculate the level distribution over a grid of receiver points (see Chapter 11.5). You can insert several calculation areas.
With the option Exclude Area in the edit dialog Calculation Area it is
possible to exclude for a calculation another area inside the existing calculation area. Inside this area the receiver point grid is not calculated.
The inserted calculation areas are also registered simultaneously in Tables|Other Objects|Calculation Areas. The order of the records also determine the order of calculation.
For these calculation areas, CadnaA will take into account all objects,
even outside the calculation area, unless they are deactivated.
You may specify several calculation areas. The total area of all defined
calculation areas essentially determines the time required for the calculation. It is therefore advisable, for the first test, to specify a large spacing
between the receiver points under Grid|Properties, in order to watch the
progress of the calculation once it has been started and, if required, to
abort the calculation and restart it with a different spacing between the receiver points.

spreadsheet program, for further processing.
But be careful - even with normal projects this tables will be enormously
large. You should deactivate all sources and activate only those that shall
be analysed. (For that: after a calculation in Tables|Partial Level sort your
partial levels ascending to see which noise sources are the loudest.)
To this end, activate the check box Write Protocol in the Calculation Write Protocol 12.6

• Print on the Calculation Log dialog.
In the first case, the text editor opens the log file as ASCII text. If an error
message appears, the text editor cannot open the file because it is too big.
In this case, run a different word processor, such as MSWord, and open the
file as customary.
If you click the Print button, the Print Protocol dialog opens where you
select the printer to be used and the paper size and enter the desired printing range option. Then click Preview. The formatted protocol appears in
the print preview window.
The Preview window displays the individual formatted tables. Depending
on the size of the project, completing the print preview on the screen may
take several minutes, because also for each partial level, all intermediate
results are shown. Therefore, if necessary, specify one immission point as
printing range in the print dialog. The completion of the print preview
cannot be aborted.
The legend of the protocol can also be printed. The file PROT_END.TXT
is copied to the program directory during the installation of CadnaA. This
file generates the key at the end of the protocol. If you prefer having the
legend at the beginning, rename the file to PROT_BEG.TXT.
You can also edit the file to suit your needs. To this end, open it using an

If you hold the SHIFT key depressed while clicking the "Zoom to Limits"

the window. However, the new limits are only temporary (analogous to
the command Options|Limits|Calc), which means the limits specified by

If a line is supposed to connect to an existing line, the new first point will
be positioned precisely on the last point of the existing line, if the distance
of the two points is less than the specified object snap.
Likewise, points sources and receiver points located within that distance in
front of a building side are assigned to that building side. They will then be
positioned at a userdefined distance in front of it. The default distance is
5 cm. The object snap also allows the seamless joining of partial areas to
give one combined area, for example, for the purpose of determining noise
quota for area sources in the process of noise allotment.
If the object snap is given in pixels, the snap radius on the screen will be
independent of the selected scale. If it is given in metres, the scale must be
considered. In both cases, checking is facilitated by the effective snap radius being displayed on the monitor box.

If the Transparent option is active (box is checked), objects of the selected type appear transparent. If this option is inactive (box is not checked),
the objects appear opaque. This is useful when, e. g., a background bitmap
is used in a project. With the Transparent option activated, the bitmap is
still visible through the CadnaA objects on top of it.
If, despite the Transparent option being active, an object does not appear
transparent, this is not an error in Cadna, but in your graphics driver. (Request a new driver from the manufacturer, if necessary.) You can see

13.13 3D-Wire Model
The diagram on the screen is a projection of the entire model on the horizontal reference plane, x/y. Points and lines are thus the shadows of all object outlines, assuming that the model is illuminated by a very distant light
source located vertically above it.
Like any individual view, this top view has the disadvantage that objects
which lie one behind the other, as viewed along the direction of projection,
cannot be distinguished. The height of an object, its dimension in the z direction, cannot be seen from the horizontal projection.
In the following representation in CadnaA, the diagram will not enable
you to judge whether the immission point on a building is a single point or
a group of several points.
There are further viewing options under OPTIONS|3-D View which are
helpful here. For the example shown here, the Front View is as follows:

that value on the pertinent table, but this would be too inconvenient if you
were to check the co-ordinates of many receiver points.)
A side view of the same situation would look like this:
Checking the height is most conveniently done using the front view (looking along the y direction towards higher values of the co-ordinates, which
means upwards with respect to the screen) and the side view (looking
along the x direction towards smaller values of the co-ordinate, which
means to the left with respect to the screen).

How do we move through our virtual 3D model?
Initial Situation:
Function for control
of your model
You have a complete CadnaA project with DTM, buildings, roads, streets
and miscellaneous sources.
You would like to check your model in the Special-3D-View. You want to
have a closer look at different sections of your model. These are:
• a certain section of a road
• several sections of a road
• a certain area without roads and, of course,
• also the entire project model in the survey, seen from all directions.
For this example we are going to use the file demo1.cna, which you al- Demo1.cna
ready know and which is on your CD-Rom.
) Open the file Demo1.cna (File|Open). Example
) If there is a coloured grid activated in the file, deactivate it in the
menu Grid|Appearance|No grid. A calculated receiver point grid is
also represented in the Special-3D-View - from CadnaA version 3.0
upward - regardless whether this view is activated in the normal
view.
In Calculation|Configuration (see Chapter 12.4.6) we have activated
DTM|Search Contour Lines (Average). You can also activate the option
Triangulation . There is no terrain model in this example, therefore this aspect is insignificant.
Nevertheless we would like to describe some features related to the alternative terrain models in 3D (Special):
• You do not have to calculate a grid to see the terrain model in 3D (Special) when Triangulation is activated.
13.15 Chapter 13 Graphics

• The terrain model will build up faster with Triangulation than with
the option Search Contour Lines.
• The coloured representation of the receiver point’s grid is more coarse
in 3D (Special). You can modify this a little if you select a value >1 in
Grid|Appearance|Raster, Oversampling.
Just try it: Enter the value 5. After that you can activate the option No
grid again. This has no effect on the 3D (Special) view, as you already
know.
) In our example we click on the Sandrachweg - the street running
straight from the lower left-hand corner to the upper right-hand corner - with the right mouse key at an optional point on the middle axis
and select in the context menu 3D (Special). The 3D (Special) dialog

Point x 55, y 96, z 100 relative
Point x 122 y 147 z 50 relative
(Remember: activate the icon in the toolbox and just enter the value -
the polygon point dialog opens!)
After you have entered the auxiliary polygon
) click on it with the RIGHT mouse key and select 3D (Special).
You now look on the demo example from 100 m (first point) down to
50 m (second point). You are looking again from the first to the last
point. If you press Return, you will move along this line.
Play a little with the length of the polygon - shorten or extend it and have a
look at the effect. Select initial and final height or shift the polygon. Leave
the 3D (Special) window open.
Road Sections In practice it will happen that a road consists of several sections, due to
changing data (not as smooth as in our demo example). So what can you
do to move along this partitioned road (by pressing RETURN) in your virtual model without interruption?
You can insert a continuous auxiliary polygon along the road you want to
move on. If you did this with your mouse, you would probably be stopped
by the virtual police for an alcohol check.

You better duplicate the road, join the duplicates to form a continuous road
(Connect Lines ) and convert it into an auxiliary polygon afterwards. Just
try it.
* Auxiliary polygons are not visible in the Special 3D-View.
If this leads to sharp bends, straighten them out by selecting Spline in the
context menu (right mouse key) and, if necessary, correct the design of the
lines. You would move along this center line anyway - even if you had not
executed Spline - in case the automatic movement around the bend was
impossible at the given speed.

The simulation of a Pass-By Level (see Chapter 8.14) and the movement
in the 3D-Special view (see Chapter 13.14) can be recorded in a video.
Such a file, like an AVI-format, can be replayed with a corresponding
Windows Media Player independent of CadnaA.
A powerful tool for presentational purposes.
In order to use the video function, you need on your system the corresponding video driver which is able to decode and encode pictures.

download this decoder for free (http://www.divx.com). Please understand
that we are not responsible for this software and that we cannot support it

Recording
a Pass-By as
Video
For the video recording of a pass-by a lot of receiver point grids are calculated. The number of calculated grids depents on the number of pictures
which are recorded per second (Framerate (fps)).
If you enter, e.g., the value 15 in the field Framerate, for the replay, 15
grids per second are calculated and recorded while the entered speed is
taken into account for the object which is passing by.
So, before you select the command Pass-By Level from the context menu
make all your desired settings for a grid calculation in menu Grid and
maybe also in the menu Calculation|Configuration.
Afterwards choose the command Pass-By Level from the context menu of
the corresponding line object and enter the desired setting

14.2 Insert Bitmaps
* The option BMP is only available if you have purchased it.
There are two types of computer graphics: Bitmaps and Vektor graphics. In
CadnaA we can open or import (see Chapter 14.3 "Import Bitmap") different formats of Bitmaps.
Bitmaps use a color grid (pixel) for the display of images. Each pixel is as- Bitmaps 14.2
signed a certain position and a color value. With bit-mapped images pixels
are worked on, not objects or figures.
Bitmaps are the current electronic medium for half tone images as, e.g.,
photos or digital drawings because the shades and colors can be reproduced in fine gradations. Bitmaps are resolution dependent, that means
they have a solid number of pixels. Scaling on the screen or during print
out with a resolution which is too low can therefore result in the losing of
details or in irregularities in appearance.
Vector graphics contain lines and curves which are defined by mathemati- Vector graphics 14.2
cal objects - so-called vectors. Vectors describe images on the basis of
their geometric properties. This type of graphics is not used in CadnaA.
The bitmap option is frequently used to insert scanned maps such as surveyor’s plan, land register or catastral plan. They serve as a background
pattern for inputing noise sources, receiver points and other objects with
acoustical meaning. But also photos, e.g., digital pictures of machines,
buildings or others which have the JPEG format. The number of pictures
you can insert depends, of course, on your hardware, on the memory capacity of your equipment and on the resolution (DPI) of your image files.
CadnaA does not save the bitmaps in the cna-file but refers to the bitmap
files with their file name and pathes. If you now shift your project cna-file
and the bitmap into a different folder on your hard drive, CadnaA will find
the bitmap if the cna-file and the bitmaps file are in the same folder.
We have several different possibilities for inserting bitmaps in our project
file:

• via the table (Tables|Other Objects|Bitmap)
• with the toolbox icon and
• by importation via File|Import (see Chapter 14.3 "Import Bitmap") or
• ODBC interface (see Chapter 6.5). This procedure is advantageous if a
lot of bitmaps shall be included in one CadnaA-file and if a list exist
(e.g. MS-Excel file) which contains all file name of the bitmaps and
their corner coordinates. In that case all bitmaps will be imported and
placed in the CadnaA graphics automatically.
Pull up an arbitrary sized frame with the icon from the toolbox . If no bitmap has been inserted yet, a frame with a bitmap sign appears.
An empty bitmap frame - a bitmap file has not been selected yet.
If you have already defined a bitmap and if you insert another frame, the
new frame will also contain the last selected bitmap file.

dialog will open in which you can select the desired bitmap file.

Manual

14
14.2.1 Bitmap Size and Position
To avoid a distorted representation of the background image on the
CadnaA main window, you must specify its dimensions and its intended
position within the main window or the limits.
You may do so by entering
1. the co-ordinates of the bottom left and top right corners, or Coordinates 14.2.1
2. the resolution of the map in dots per inch (DPI) and the scale, or
3. reference points, the coordinates of which are known (calibration).
If the Resolution option is activated, you must know the resolution in DPI Resolution 14.2.1
(e. g. 150, 200, 400 etc.) used when the map was scanned and the scale of
the map. This method is particularly convenient if only the relative positions of objects matter, and their absolute coordinates are irrelevant.
Calibrate
Bitmap 14.2.1
The Calibrate Bitmap button opens a dialog which allows you to enter up
to four points with known coordinates on the map. As soon as you have
entered these points and confirmed by clicking OK, CadnaA will load the
bitmap and prompt you to click the reference points on the bitmap which is
displayed on the screen. CadnaA will then determine the correct coordinates for the representation. Under this mode, you may use the zoom magnifiers to enlarge the reference point to be clicked.
You should always select this method when more than one bitmap file is to
be inserted because in this case the absolute position of the bitmaps is decisive for a correct representation. In practice bitmaps will overlap, particularly near the edges because the scanning causes discontinuities not
present in the original map.
When all reference points have been identified, you can save this calibrated bitmap under a different name. You need not do so, however. It is con-

venient, when the calibrated bitmap is large, up to several Megabytes, and,
moreover, has been rotated because of the calibration. CadnaA calculates
the position of the bitmap, which may take several minutes. Saving the bitmap in the right position means not having to re-calculate it when the file
is opened again.
Save the entered coordinates under a name so you can reload them by just
selecting that name.

14.3 Import Bitmap
* The import of bitmaps only works properly if the Option Bitmap
has been purchased.
The bitmap format used for File|Import enables you to automatically
place bitmap files (e.g., tif files) in bitmap frames, provided that the corner
coordinates of the bitmap are saved in the equally named additional file
with the extension TFW and both files are in the same directory (e.g., bitmap file named 34139ca2.tif and coordinate information file named
34139ca2.tfw).
You can select the files to be imported by multiple choice . It is of no significance whether you mark the TFW file or not - CadnaA will find the
corresponding information and will automatically load all files one after
another.
You can also import other bitmap files with the same method. In this case
you do not have to create a bitmap frame from the toolbox. CadnaA will
automatically create this frame in the lower left corner of your limits, giving it a size of 10 x 10 m. You can adjust this frame accordingly in the edit
dialog as usual.
Following Bitmap formats can be imported for the time being (modifications subject to change at any time):
CALS Raster, DCX, GEM Image (IMG), IOCA (ICA), JFIF, JPEG, JTIF,
LEAD CMP, Macintosh Pict (PCT Macintosh QuickDraw), MacPaint
(MAC), Microsoft Paint (MSP), MPT (Multipage TIFF), OS/2 Bitmap,

files can be saved with different scales and with a definable resolution for
quick loading via the internet.
This „pre-work“ makes it possible to place, e.g., your projects on your
Homepage to provide your customers or market with information about
your work. The interested person can then have a look at representations of
your project with different resolution by zooming in or out.
Bitmaps saved with different scales.
Before you execute the export command draw a Section (see Chapter

CadnaA then saves the necessary number of bitmaps, dependent on the
chosen options, automatically with the equivalent extensions in alphabetical order. For the following example three files with different scales have
been saved.
Webtest_demo1_a.bmp is the file with the largest scale (whereas
Webtest_demo1 was the original file name and a is the extension),

Enter the desired resolution in dpi. But remember - the higher the resolu- Resolution 14.4.0
tion the longer the loading time of the bitmaps. 100 dpi are normaly sufficient. The bitmaps are created with the resolution of the computer screen if
you don’t enter a resolution on your own. This resolution is normaly sufficient, also.
Generate
Tiles 14.4.0
You can divide your project file if it is too big. In that case activate the option Generate Tiles. CadnaA then divides the file automatically in the defined size (Width and Hight of Tiles) and generates for each section or
tiles the corresponding number of bitmaps with the settings entered under
Option. Sections without any objects are not created if the check box Suppress empty Tiles is activated.
CadnaA cannot supply the program for the handling of the bitmaps in the
internet but each „Web-Programer“ can process the bitmaps. If you are interested in this you can also get in touch with us of course. You will find an
example with http://www.noiseRus.com.

* Hints regarding Editing:
• Clicking a table row will not result in the entire row, but only an individual cell being selected (highlighted). This becomes the active cell
which you can edit. The corresponding graphical object will also be
selected.
• The up and down arrow keys (↓ ↑) serve to navigate from one row to
the next, and the left and right arrow keys (→ ←) do the same for the
cells of a row.
• You can edit the selected cell by entering the desired value or text. A
vertical-bar cursor (|) will appear in that cell. Any existing value will
be overwritten (overwriting mode). Please also note how to enter decimals (see Chapter 5.5.4).
• There are two editing modes: Overwrite (default) and Insert. Under
the overwriting mode, any existing text is overwritten (deleted completely). Under the insertion mode you can modify the text, add to it, or
delete it using the BACKSPACE and DEL keys.
• If you wish to add to the existing text, or correct it, press the F2 key
(insertion mode). Any text in the cell will be retained. You can move
the vertical-bar cursor backwards and forwards across the text using
the left and right arrow keys (→ ←).

This can be either a conversion of numerical values (arithmetics) or a
modification (substitution) of character strings.
For the examples below, you should open a table – for example the table of
point sources – of a CadnaA project, or just enter a few points and open
the pertinent table of object.
Click the column to be edited using the RIGHT mouse button. On the context menu, select Change Column.
Range of
Rows 15.2.5
In the dialog which then opens, you may restrict the modification to a
Range of rows up to or starting from a row which you specify by clicking
it. In the default setting, all elements of the selected column will be modified.
If the column contains numerical values, both arithmetic and string conversion are possible. In all other cases, only string conversion is possible.
The current numerical value may be replaced by a different constant value, Arithmetic 15.2.5
or by one that is computed from the current value.
+, -, /, * are operators used as customary. x stands for the current value.
++ and -- stand for level addition and subtraction.
see Chapter 2.6 Examples of Formulas and Operators
Replace
String 15.2.5
This operation may be required if a data record, e. g., the CadnaA project
for an enterprise, is to be embedded in larger limits, requiring modification
of the ID code.

The characters * (asterix: arbitrary number of arbitrary characters) and ?
(questionsmark: one arbitrary character) act as wildcards used as customary. If sections of a string are to be re-used in the conversion, these are enclosed in brackets.
Replace with In the box Replace with: you may combine arbitrary character strings
with the string sections marked by brackets in the search string. \1 . . . \n is
used as a symbol for these marked string sections (see Chapter 2.8).
This flexible logic allows you to perform practically any operation required to convert strings.
Automatic
Numbering in Tables15.2.5
With the rhombus # you can number automatically the column in your tables. One rhombus # results in a one digit value from 1 to 9, two rhombuses ## result in a two digit value from 01 to 99, three rhombuses result in a
three digit value from 001 to 999 and so on. After the value 9 CadnaA
starts with 0 again.
Enter the rhombus in the field replace with.

15.3 The Result Table
CadnaA contains an efficient generator of tables which can represent all
results for defined receiver points in any desired way. If you want to represent the evaluation of projects in the customary form of a table, you have
to generate a template for this table. Afterwards this template will only
have to be referred to in order to represent calculation results in a standardized way.
Therefore, save the default table with a different name and adjust it as desired. In each project in which you open this template table the results will
be displayed in the created shape. The template table has the extension
CNT.
The Result tables can be printed out directly with the button Print or the
layout can be seen in the print preview.

Global libraries are available for all project files, whereas local libraries
apply only to the project in process. They are accessable via the Tables
menu.
You can insert user-defined spectra in all libraries via the keyboard or by
importation. The importation can happen via the library manager (see
Chapter 16.4) provided that these are CadnaA files. Spectra from thirdparty files can be imported in the local library via the ODBC database interface (see Chapter 6.5).
In the globale library you will find data records for
• Spectra (see Chapter 16.3)
- sound levels (see Chapter 16.3.3)
- sound reduction indices (see Chapter 16.3.4)
- absorption coefficients (see Chapter 16.3.5)
• SET-S (see Chapter 8.16)
• Parking lot events (see Chapter 8.13)
• Railway Groups (see Chapter 8.12.2)
• Text blocks (see Chapter 16.6)
and in the local library

16.3 Spectra
The Sound Level Spectra table already lists a number of spectra. These
are the typical indoor level spectra for commercial enterprises as listed in
the Guideline VDI 2571 /14/.
This chapter deals with the spectra. We assume that you are already familiar with the edit dialog of the objects for general sources
• point, (see Chapter 8.3)
• line (see Chapter 8.4) and
• area sources (see Chapter 8.5): horizontal and vertical,
The Sound Level Spectra library stores sound pressure levels and sound
power levels independent of their weighting. You can supplement this library according to your needs.
* Spectra are made with reference to their ID.
If you require a spectrum from the global library for a project file, it will
be copied to the local library by either:
) copying all required spectra in advance by pressing the Local
Library button,
or
) copying the required spectra while working on the project. By
making reference to a spectrum via the edit dialog of an object, it will
be automatically copied to the local library.
* Remember: From the edit dialog, you access the global library by
clicking the card index icon of the PWL box with the SHIFT key held
down.

• must not contain blanks,
• must not contain operators (+;-;/;* etc.) - (see if necessary chapter 2.6
Operators and Functions), and
• no special characters (see if necessary chapter 2.8 Strings and Operators).
We suggest the following:
Use the first letter to denote the type of sound level, for example
- L = sound pressure
- P = sound power
- R = sound reduction
- A = absorption
Append a serial number, for example L001, L002, P001, P002. In this context please read chapter 15.2.5 Change Column Content.

Spectrum and
Weighting 16.3.1
A spectrum may A-, B-, C-, D-, or Lin-weighted. The spectrum list box

* Select the weighting before you enter the spectrum.
The Weighting column of the table lists the corresponding letter codes. A
blank entry means the spectrum is Lin-weighted.

power and indoor levels
In order to understand the following, we presuppose that your are familiar
with dealing with frequency spectra, their generation, storage and transfer,
as well as the use of the global and local libraries.
It is also possible to calculate the frequency spectra of the sound power
level, e.g., from measured sound level spectra.
These features are reached when generating a new spectrum in the local or
in the global library.
Example: Insert a new line in the local library and open the dialog by double-clicking this line.

Li Li indicates that the entered, or in some other way generated, spectrum is
an indoor sound pressure level - e.g. for the calculation of the radiation
from a building . This can be useful for documentation.
Li from interior
sources
With this option the level of an indoor sound spectrum can be calculated
from the level of a spectrum of sound power from sound sources like machines etc.
In principle this calculation requires a statistical theory. For each frequency band the following formula applies:
(1)
For
Li Indoor level in a room with the frequency band in dB
LW Sound power level of all sources with the frequency band i in dB
A equivalent absorption area with the frequency band in m²
The equivalent absorption area is calculated with the following formula:

with
α the average absorption coefficient of the room’s surface areas
S the area in m² of the room’s surface
Practical
procedure 16.3.2
The spectra of the sound power level of the single sources in a room have
to be saved so that they can be referenced with their identifier (ID).
After selection of the option Li from interiour sources from the list Type
new lines can be inserted in the list of Interiour Sources in the usual way.

After double-clicking on the inserted new line, single spectra can be referenced by typing their ID or you can choose the desired spectrum directly
from the library by clicking the index card symbol.
In the box Absorption displayed in the dialog Spectrum you can either
enter a single value of the average characteristic coefficient of absorption
or the ID-Code of a coefficient-spectrum of absorption from the local library. By clicking the index card symbol the spectrum can be chosen directly from the local or - with SHIFT key - global library.
When the surface of the room in m² is specified, the resulting indoor level
of a spectrum is displayed as well in the monitor as in the corresponding

The spectrum of an interior level Li04 for the „Plastic-box-production“ is
therefore the result if 3 moulding machines, 5 presses and 6 circular saw
bands are running in a room with a surface area of 1020 m² and an average
spectrum of absorption, spectrum Am from the local library.
The additional parameter (c) with the type-name Li(c) shows that this
spectrum has been calculated from other spectra. Its values cannot be
changed by editing.
Lw 16.3.2 Lw indicates that the entered, or in some other way generated, spectrum is
a sound-power-level - e.g., to define the radiation of an outdoor source.
This can be useful for documentation.
Lw calculated from Lp
+ area + near-fieldcorrection 16.3.2
With this option the determination of the sound power level from the radiation from openings is supported. The averaged sound pressure level spectrum is determined by measurement in the opening cross-section.
An example is the spectrum LOE1 in the following figure:

This spectrum shall be determined in a 2 m² large cross-section of an outlet
of an exhauster. After double-clicking this line the corresponding edit dialog opens. In the field TYP the option Lw calculated from Lp + area +
nearfield-correction is selected.
In addition to the size of the exit area a short distance-correction can be entered which will then be added arithmetically to the frequency-band level.
With this correction it can be taken into account that the rays don't cross
the exit area vertically - only in this case, apply the following conversion
formula

S exit area in m2
* (Hint: If sound penetrates the area S from all directions, a correction
of -3 dB may be useful. This is the case, e.g., if sound radiated from
machines in a room penetrates the environment through an open
door. In the exit-cross-section of an absorbent duct there are no crossmodes and the near-field correction is 0. In a duct without any
absorption a value between 0 and -3 may be correct depending on the

surface method in accordance with one of the standards ISO 3744 /3/ or
3746 /40/. In many cases it is appropriate to measure the sound emission
of a source at a distance that is large in comparison to source dimensions
and to use only one or a few measuring points if the source radiation is
unidirectional. If the radiation has a direction, the measurements are undertaken at more points oriented in different directions and a mean spectrum is calculated in the first step by energetic averaging. If the source
doesn't radiate in all directions, but only into a portion n% of the sphere,
then the sound power level Lw is calculated from the measured level Lp

16.3.3 Sound Level Spectra
Level Frequency
Spectra 16.3.3
A level-over-frequency spectrum is a sequence of values, with each value
signifying a level in a specific octave band. Entering zero as a value, not
entering anything, or a blank, are interpreted in different ways. 0 means
that the level is 0 dB. A blank, or no entry, mean that this frequency band
has no valid entry.
If spectra are available, the calculation, evaluation, and representation of
the rating level at the immission point will be based on the spectral information. If, however, there is no value in a frequency band of the spectrum
for a source being taken into account in the calculation, no rating level will
be displayed for this band.
A level-over-frequency spectrum is only unambiguous if the underlying Weighting 16.3.3
frequency weighting – Lin, A, B, C, or D – is known. To ensure unambiguity, the relevant standards always require Lin-weighted spectra. In practical noise control, however, using the A-weighted levels has proven
convenient, too, because it allows you to determine the relative contribution of each frequency band level at the A-weighted sound level – the value of ultimate interest – by just looking at the values. This facilitates a
quick selection of those frequency ranges which need to be considered
first in the constructing of noise-control measures. There is a risk, however, that spectra with different weightings are mixed in an inadmissible way.
CadnaA makes use of a concept which avoids this risk while still allowing
a quick visual evaluation by means of weighted frequency spectra.
• Spectra may be entered with any of the Lin-, A-, B-, C-, or D-weightings, the user being responsible for supplying correct information on
the weighting. (Only this information allows for the correct calculation
of the unweighted spectrum.)
• If you mistakenly entered the wrong weighting, you may modify this at
any time by assigning a different weighting.
• Any of the weightings mentioned above can be selected for output on

the screen, or on the printer, either globally for all spectra of one table,
or individually for each one of them.
An example of how to enter a spectrum is given below.
) Open the appropriate, currently blank, table of the local library via
Tables|Libraries [local]|Sound Level.
) Insert a row, and open the edit dialog (by double-clicking the inserted
row).
This standard spectrum with a level of 0 dB in each frequency band is valid for the entire frequency range from 31.5 Hz to 8,000 Hz. Nine valid frequency bands with a level of 0 dB each result in a total Lin-weighted level,
indicated as Total Lin: of
(0 + 10 x lg(9)) dB = 9.5 dB
The A-weighted level is 7.0 dB(A).
) Change the weighting from Linear to, e. g., A by either
- entering A in the Spectrum box, or
- by selecting a weighting from the list which drops down when
you click the arrow to the right of the Spectrum box.
You will then see the weighted spectral levels.

) Repeat this with different weightings, and watch the total weighted
level displayed on the dialog in each case.
* Switching to another weighting in the edit dialog Spectrum does not
change the underlying frequency spectrum.
Therefore, at first, switch to the appropriate weighting before you
enter a frequency spectrum.
But even if you selected the wrong weighting and confirmed the values
you entered, you do not need to delete them in order to just enter them
again. The second important dialog, Modify Spectrum, is one tool to help
you here.
) First, switch back to Linear on the edit dialog Spectrum which
results in 0 being again displayed for each frequency band.
) Click the calculator icon to the right of the Spectrum box.
In the default setting, Apply Weighting is activated, with the A-weighting
being selected.
If you click OK now, the A-weighting will be applied to the values, but the
Linear weighting will still be assigned to the spectrum in the edit dialog.
* Selecting a specific weighting in the Modify Spectrum dialog means
converting and thus manipulating the values. This implies an actual
modification of the spectrum saved in the library.

The edit dialog should now look similar to the following illustration:
Now the A-weighting corrections are displayed as levels. Your procedure
tells the program to interpret and process this spectrum as Lin-weighted.
Again, switching to other weightings on the edit dialog will not affect the
spectrum saved in the library.
This is very convenient if you have entered the correct values but the
wrong weighting. Suppose you enter the above sequence of values directly
as a Lin-weighted spectrum. Afterwards, you find out that during the
measurement of these values, the instrument had been set to measure Aweighted levels.
Since you have selected Lin-weighting, you wish to generate linear levels
from the measured A-weighted levels, thus applying a kind of an inverse
A-weighting. Therefore,

which opens.

By clicking OK, the original spectrum is restored to the edit dialog.
* Instead of selecting a different weighting via the dialog Modify
Spectrum and in order to leave the values unchanged, you may also
switch to a different weighting directly on the Spectrum dialog.
When doing so, hold the SHIFT key down.

Modify
 Spectrum 16.3.3
The three other options on the Modify Spectrum dialog similarly lead to a
manipulation of the values.
• Fill Spectrum with Constant K
- enters an arbitrary value K for each band.
• Add Constant K to Bands
- arithmetically adds the value of K to the current value.
• Normalise Spectrum to Total Level K
- adds the same correction to each frequency band value so that
the resulting total level, weighted as specified on the edit dialog,
equals the value of K.
This gives you extreme flexibility in handling spectra while maintaining
consistency in the data. We recommend you try out the combinations described above as well as the many other possible ones.

) Insert a new row and open the edit dialog.
Unlike the edit dialog for the level spectrum, this one does not assign any
weighting to the values. This would not make any sense with sound reduction indices.
Instead it will be indicated the weighted sound reduction index Rw - determined from these values in accordance with DIN EN ISO 717-1 /25/ - and
the spectrum adaptation terms C and Ctr which also depend on the spectrum. All tools for the manipulation of spectra, as described above, are accessible via the calculator icon and effective here.
Applying a weighting here, however, is to be understood as a purely arithmetic operation without any relation to noise effects which are implied in
sound level spectra. By activating, e. g., Fill Spectrum with Constant K,
where K=50, and with the subsequent selection of A on the Apply
Weighting box, you generate an approximately realistic sound reduction
index spectrum with a weighted sound reduction index of 49 dB. If you
then select Normalise Spectrum to Total Level K, you generate a sound

The input dialog for absorption coefficients in octave bands is accessed via

Unlike the edit dialog for the spectrum of sound level, this one does not assign any weighting to the values. This would not make any sense with absorption coefficients.
Instead, the reflection loss DLA,a,Str - determined from these values by the
method given in ZTV-Lsw 88 /55/, and the weighted absorption aw which
also depends on the spectrum - are given. All tools for the manipulation of
spectra, as described above and accessible via the calculator icon, are effective here, too.
However, it does not make sense to apply a weighting here, because reasonable sound absorption coefficients lie between 0 and 1.
(Such manipulations are only useful for practise, and to study the effects of
modifications to parameters. For other projects, you should enter values in
the edit dialog which have been measured ).

Use Global Properties is deactivated in the dialog of the Aux. Polygon
with which the image is drawn then you can only change its appearance in
this object dialog.
These settings are then allocated to this image and cannot be changed anymore in another project file in which this image is inserted as Symbol object.
If, in the original file, the option Use Global Properties is activated then
the image is adopted to the colour and line width of the project file in
which it is inserted, provided that this option has been activated in the dialog Library Symbol, too. Otherwise you can still adjust the settings individually in this dialog.
The Symbol library is a local library and is therefore only available in the

Use text blocks (Table|Libraries local and global) to save global or individual (local) text blocks which can be printed along with a report or exported from CadnaA by simply naming them in the template file. The key
word for the template file for this purpose is #(Text,Identifier) where the
identifier is the name of the text block.
Edit Dialog Textblock
This allows you to include, e. g., your company address, the identification
of the project or your customer's address in the report without having to
edit the template file over and over again.
There are local and global text blocks and also automatically generated
textblocks which are created if the Project-Info (see Chapter 18.10) has
been filled out. The global text blocks are available for every CadnaA file,
whereas the local ones are saved together with the specific project, thus
being available for this project only. Local and global text blocks may
share the same identifier. CadnaA will search through all text blocks. If
two text blocks having the same identifier are found, the local one will be
used.

17.2 Creating Reports and Graphics
CadnaA allows you to export all calculation results and intermediate results, as well as object descriptions in ASCII or RTF format, and to export
graphics in the DXF format , or to have everything printed out using standardised printing commands. Examples are:
• Calculation results and object descriptions in formatted tables via
File|Print Report, either standard or user-defined (see Chapter 17.2.2)
• intermediate results of receiver point calculations via Calculation|Log|Print (see Chapter 12.6)
• graphic representations via File|Print Graphics, either standard or
user-defined (see Chapter 17.2.3) and
• the export of tables and diagrams via the Windows clipboard (see
Chapter 5.4.5)
User-defined output can be realised in CadnaA by using template files
(see Chapter 17.2.1) for exporting and printing.
With the corresponding print drivers - like, e.g., PDF-Writer by ADOBE -
you can also save your files for archive purposes or transfer these PDF
files to your customers via email.

17.2.1 Template Files
Template files contain commands controlling the printing or exporting of
calculation results or diagrams.
Key words (see Chapter 17.4) are essential components of the commands.
Write these commands and any individual text into a file using either a text
editor or a word processor, and save this file in TXT (ASCII) format or
RTF (Rich Text Format). Then select these as template files for user-defined output.
If you want, e.g., to print out the current receiver point table in a user-defined report then you would enter the command #(Table,Imm). The result is the current table of receiver points in your CadnaA file.
Key words must appear in brackets, preceded by a # before the left bracket. The parameters of a key word come next to the key word itself, enclosed in the same brackets and separated by commas.
Another example of a command in a printing template file:
#(Font, Times Roman, 14, f)Cadna/A
has the effect that the word Cadna/A will be printed using the Times
Roman font, 14 pt size, and bold faced.

You may also enter an ordinary text without using a key word. This text
will be printed or exported, too. This allows you to prepare standard reports or logs containing the current calculation results.
The following types of template files are presently distributed and can be
either used as they are or modified (edited):
• Print.TXT = Template file for direct printout from CadnaA
• Export.TXT= Template file for exporting. The output file to which the
results are exported is also an ASCII file which can be imported by any
program capable of processing ASCII files (including, e. g., Excel).
• Export.RTF = Template file for exporting. The output file to which
the results are exported is also a Rich Text Format file which can be
recognised and imported by almost any word processor. Tables, e. g.,
will remain tables with frames when imported to the word processor (e.
g., Word). Characters, paragraphs, and tab stops can be formatted
directly in the word processor.
• Print_Gr. TXT = Template file for printing out diagrams. This template file contains commands regarding, among other items, size and
caption of the diagram, whether a frame shall be drawn, or whether coordinates or scale shall be printed etc.
Labelling of Printing
Ranges 17.2.1
The template files, such as Print.TXT, which controls the standard printout
of reports from CadnaA can be structured by labelling ##printing ranges.
These will appear for selection in the Print dialog. Printing ranges may be
selected individually, which allows you to print out just one printing range.
Where a printing range starts in the template file, enter a text - preferably
one word, no blanks - identifying this range. Before this text, without
blanks in between, insert two ##.
General syntax ##PrintingRangeLabel
Example: ##LineSources
"LineSources" now appears as a selectable printing range in the print dialog. Anything appearing in the template file after "LineSources", but before the next printing range label, is printed. The label itself is not printed.

* This version of PRINT.TXT will be overwritten when CadnaA is reinstalled or updated. It is therefore strongly recommended that you
save the template file PRINT.TXT with a different name if any
changes are made!
The Choose button allows you to select a template file for printing. Template file names have the extension TXT. Since, among others, the names
of the template files for exporting have the same extension, it may be advisable to save template files for exporting and for printing in different directories on your disk because some key words (see Chapter 17.4) are
permissible for exporting only, but not for printing.

Command (see Chapter 17.4.22):
#(PosPush)
Saves the current position for subsequent retrieval. In our example, the
current position is the top left corner (x/y = 0/0 - Standard).
17.2.4 Chapter 17.2 Creating Reports and Graphics
Example: Template File for Graphics of a User-defined Printout
Manual

17
Command (see Chapter 17.4.23):
#(RectAbs,-1,-1)
draws a rectangle from the current position (top left corner) to the positions specified by the parameters 1 and 2. In this case, parameter 1 is the
distance in millimetres from the right page margin (because the value is
negative), and parameter 2 is the distance in millimetres from the bottom
margin (because the value is negative).
The margin is the distance from the permissible printing range of the
printer in question plus the page margins entered on the print menu.
Now the current position is the bottom right corner, 1 mm from the bottom
margin, and 1 mm from the right margin.
#(Font,,6)#(PosPush)#(RectAbs,-1,-1)#(PosPop,,,z)
The command #(PosPop,,,z) retrieves from the stack (memory) the position previously saved using PosPush (the top left corner in our example),
making it the current position, without removing the saved position from
the stack. The current position is the top left corner again.
#(Font,,6)#(PosPush)#(RectAbs,-1,-1)
#(PosPop,,,z) #(PlanAttr)#(Plan,-60,-1,-1)
The command #(Plan,-60,-1) (see Chapter 17.4.19) identifies the area
where the diagrams are to be placed.
The first parameter defines the position, in millimetres, from the right margin (negative value), i. e. 6 cm from the right margin in our example.
The second parameter defines the position, in millimetres, from the bottom
margin, i. e. 1 mm from the bottom print margin in our example.
The third parameter (>0) is the scale factor. 1,000 for example means that
the diagram is printed at a scale of 1:1,000. If the third parameter is negative (as in the example), the scale will be chosen to fit the specified paper
size. If the third parameter is not given, as in #(Plan,-60,-1), the scale specified for the representation on the screen will be used.

The fourth parameter determines whether to print the limits, the area visible on the screen (enter Window instead of Limits), or a Section. In the latter case, the name of the section must be given. If the name of the section
is, e. g., Development_Area, this must be entered. In our example, the set
scale will be used for printing.
If no fourth parameter is given, the option selected on the print dialog is
applied.
#(PlanAttr) (see Chapter 17.4.20) without parameters is drawn in the area
where the graphics are placed without a coordinate scale. This key word
must appear before the command #(Plan). The map attribute #(PlanAttr,20,tblr), on the other hand, draws a coordinate scale at a specified distance (first parameter) of 20 mm from each side of the diagramw. The
second parameter tblr determines which sides to place the scale on – top,
bottom, left, right. In this case, all four sides are scaled.

So far the complete command is, including the coordinate scale,
#(Font,,6)#(PosPush)#(RectAbs,-1,-1)
#(PosPop,,,z) #(PlanAttr,20,oulr) #(Plan,-60,-1,)
If you find the distance too large between the scale and the diagram,
change the command to #(PlanAttr,5,tblr). It will only be 5 mm thencommand.
#(Font,,6)#(PosPush)#(RectAbs,-1,-1) #(PosPop)
#(PosPush) #(PlanAttr,5,oulr) #(Plan,-60,-1,-
1,Limits)#(PosPop,x)
The command #(PosPop,x) leaves the current x coordinate unchanged
and, in this example, retrieves from the stack the y coordinate (=0) saved
using #(PosPush).This y coordinate becomes the current position.

As a result of the command #(MoveRel,5) (see Chapter 17.4.17), the current position is moved to the right by 5 mm, making this the new current
position.
The command #(Einzug) (see Chapter 17.4.3) indents to this position everything that follows.
The command #(Font,,10) results in all subsequent texts being printed using the Arial font, 10 pt size.
The very first font command in our template file remains valid until the
next font command is given. This means that the coordinate scale of the

If you wish to print an image, or a logo, in either bitmap or metafile format, one of the commands #(Bitmap) (see Chapter 17.4.1) or #(Metafile)
(see Chapter 17.4.15) - with the pertinent parameters - must appear in the
template file.
To avoid having to save and retrieve the current position over and over
again using PosPush and PosPop, it is useful to put this command at the
end of the template file, and enter absolute dimensions like in the following example.
#(MoveAbs,-40,110)#(Bitmap,c:\dtp\bilder\schelm01.bmp,10,20)
#(MoveAbs,-40,110) sets the current position to 4 cm from the right margin and 11 cm from the top margin.
#(Bitmap, path + file name, horizontal size, vertical size)
The commands MoveAbs and Bitmap should appear on one line. (Otherwise, an additional RETURN would be made from the absolute position).

17.5 The Connection CadnaA with
BASTIAN
BASTIAN is a program for building acoustics by Saint-Gobain Isover
G + H AG in Ladenburg, Germany. BASTIAN calculates the airborne and
impact sound insulation according to EN 12354 /52/ part 1, 2 and 3 in frequency spectra or with single number ratings. All performance parameters
according to ISO 717-1 and -2 /53/ are available. Furthermore BASTIAN
enables the calculation of the structural reverberation time according to
EN 12354-1, annex C. BASTIAN has been developed by Datakustik, Munich.
Now, how does CadnaA work together with BASTIAN?
The sound levels are calculated with CadnaA at defined receiver points -
e.g., in front of building facades. In the program BASTIAN, when simultanously opened, these receiver points are visible in the list of the outdoor
sources during calculation of sound transmission.
This enables you to calculate the indoor level with a building construction
defined in BASTIAN. With this connection the indoor level is immediately displayed correctly if the outdoor level has been changed - e.g., because
a noise barrier has been inserted in CadnaA. The corresponding construction of the building then follows with BASTIAN.

18.2 Groups
By means of the ID (see Chapter 5.5.3) for all objects and by the group
definition relying on it, CadnaA offers a versatile and powerful tool for
data management. If appropriate rules are observed in the definition of the
ID, a project and the data stock it is based on can be supplemented at any
time by entering or importing further data without creating problems with
either the clear identification of the individual sources or with the definition of groups. If the syntax is strictly observed, data stocks may be combined with other stocks at any time. This means that establishing and
observing strict ID syntax rules will, in the end, determine the value of a
data stock. Such issues are dealt with in detail in the "Advanced CadnaA"
training course.
Open the list of groups on the Tables|Group menu - the edit dialog Group
opens. The list is empty if no groups have been defined.
A group is a labelled selection of objects. All objects belonging to one
group are identified by the character string entered in the Expression box
which refers to the object ID (see Chapter 5.5.3 "The Dialog Boxes Name,
ID, INFO").
The following features are available for groups:
• Activation and deactivation for the calculation (to calculate variants)

* Groups have a hierarchic structure. This is achieved in the order in
which the groups are arranged in the list of groups because this list is
checked from top to bottom when verifying the activation state of an
object. If you activate or deactivate a group of objects in one line, any
specification in groups further down the list will be ineffective for
these objects.

18.2.1 Defining Groups
Whether or not an object belongs to a group is determined by the Expression string entered in the group dialog. If the specified Expression string
matches the ID string of an object, this object belongs to the group.
Wildcards may be used in the definition of Expression strings (see Chapter 2.8 "Strings and Operators").

Defining a
Group 18.2.1

With extensive projects you should define the IDs while considering the
intended group concept.
Example
Hierachy of Groups and
their Partial
Sum Level 18.2.1
The sequence of the groups in the list and their composition has an effect
on the calculation of the partial sum-over-the-group levels shown on the
list.
* Note that you can only manipulate by grouping those objects whose
ID has been switched to neutral (grey, i. e., neither activated nor
deactivated) in the edit dialog of this object. Therefore, objects activated in the edit dialog cannot be deactivated by grouping, and vice
versa.
Six groups have been defined in the above example.
Express: Prod* Source 1 and Source 2 are assigned to the
group
Match: Prod_??5 Source 2 is assigned to the group
Match: Prod_102|Prod_105 Source 1 and Source 2 are assigned to the
group
Match: *2 Only Source 1 is assigned to the group

• The first group contains all sources in the "Production" group.
• The second contains Source 1, ID Prod_102, of "Production“ Hall 10.
• The third contains Source 2, ID Prod_105, of "Production“ Hall 10.
• The fourth contains the entire Hall 10 of "Production“.
• The fifth contains Hall 12 with the source ID Prod_123.
• The sixth contains Hall 13 with the source ID Prod_135.
None of the sources or groups were activated or deactivated during the calculation, but the Neither option was selected. This means that all groups
and sources are considered in the calculation. Therefore, you can see the
pertinent partial sum-over-the-group levels at the existing immission
points.
If you were to deactivate the first group, "Production“ - which contains all
the sources of all halls - for a calculation, none of the groups following below would be considered in this calculation. Even if they were activated,
this would not have any effect. The sequence of the groups is therefore decisive.
Now edit the string on the Expression box of the third group to read
Prod_??5, and deactivate this group. This would automatically deactivate
the sixth group as well because the string on the Expression box would
apply for this group, too. You would be unable to re-activate this group unless you either moved the sixth group before the third one and activated it
explicitly, or you activated the sources in the edit source dialog.

• V01 (all objects),
• V02 (roads deactivated and the industrial enterprise sunk in a valley)
and
• V03 (industrial sources deactivated, industrial enterprise located on top
of a mount)
If you now open the dialog in the menu Tables|Groups, these short names
appear as column headings. After the desired groups have been formed in
the way you already know, you can set-up a defined on- or off-state for
each variant by entering „+“ or „-“.
* Activate or deactivate the different groups for the variants by entering „+“ or „-“ directly into the group table of the relevant variant

You enter the reference date in the menu Tables|Variant for the corresponding variant. All objects that do not correspond to the given date will
then be deactivated.
If there is no date entered in the field info, all objects will be valid, even if
a reference date for the calculation has been entered.
If you define a date, only the objects corresponding to the date interval of
the reference date in addition to those objects that have no date will be taken into consideration in the calculation.

18.5 Managing Project Variants
Using Folders
If you have extensive files and maybe long-term projects it could be useful
to separate objects - like, e.g., buildings, road traffic or industry - by saving them in different files and linking them on demand via import for a
calculation.
This has the advantage that only the „mother-files“ have to be updated in
case of alterations and not all possible copies of this file.
You will often import separately managed files in one common file to perform a calculation.
In order to avoid having to do this manually, and to gain control of the lots
of little "Sticky Notes" listing all the files belonging to one project,
CadnaA offers you the "Folder" tool called Mappe-file.
* The CadnaA folder is an ASCII file listing the names of all CadnaA
files to be combined in one project file. As soon as you open this
Mappe-file, CadnaA automatically loads all files listed in it.
You may specify an arbitrary name for the Mappe file. (In the example below, we choose PROJECT.CNA.). As it is an ASCII file, you may edit it
using any editor (also a word processor, such as MS WORD – but then
make sure you save the file as *.TXT.). An example of such a file might
look like this:

* Each file, which is to be imported, must appear on a separate line
(RETURN). You can also insert other folders in a folder file.
This is what the above file should look like:

;now follow the files
Ground.cna
Road.cna
Bulding.cna
e:\tmp\mappe5\mappe2000\Areas.cna

When you open the Project.cna file in CadnaA, using the File|Open File
command, CadnaA opens the first file listed in Project.cna – Ground.cna

of the resulting combined file will be the name of the Mappe file. If you

* You should note this: A calculated grid, like, e. g, a noise map, cannot be imported. This is why you should list the result file first.
Remember: The first file in the folder is opened, whereas all others
are imported into the opened file. This is also why the first file should
contain all the settings, such as the calculation configuration,
because the file that is open determines the calculation configuration
and all other settings.

18.6 PCSP - Program Controlled
Segmented Processing
CadnaA is able to process more than 16 million objects per object type
without any problems, even models of cities. Therefore the limit for the
size of a processable file is normally defined by the capacity of the computer. With PCSP even this limit is broken.
Program controlled segmentation with user-defined partitioning allows
you to load automatically the segments one after another for calculation.
Thus the RAM is able to work without hard disk access.
If several CadnaA computers are at your disposal for calculation, e.g.,
within a network, they can simultaneously work on the same project file.
PCSP by CadnaA automatically organizes and manages the required processes.
1. Cover your file, which is to be calculated, with tile-like sections - we How to activate PCSP
call this "tiling" (see Chapter 13.10)
2. give the Section a special title - PART: xyz (for xyz you can choose Quick instruction
any other name)
3. start CadnaA in the batch mode (see Chapter 18.7) for calculation

) Delete the grid (GRID|Delete)
) Save the file under a different name, e.g., DemoPCSP.cna
) Paste a correspondingly large Section - in the given example in the
upper left-hand corner - in the file you would like to calculate. The
Section may have any desired size.
) Subsequently, duplicate this Section in a way that will cover your
project file entirely and seamlessly. In the given example there are
two horizontal sections and two vertical sections, altogether 4 sections. (Mark Section with the RIGHT mouse key and select Duplicate
from the context menu.) The receiver-point grid will only be calculated in the Section created this way.

Here is an example of a "tiled" file with 4 sections from which a receiverpoint grid is to be calculated. You could further modify this by pasting a
calculation area covering all Sections. In this case only the calculation
area within the tiles would be calculated.
Step 2: Name Sections
) Open the table Section (Table|Other Objects|Section)
) Open the table context menu by clicking on the column Name with
the right mouse key and select Change Column.
) To give all Sections the name PART: and a consecutive numbering,
enter the necessary information into the dialog box as is shown in the
following picture.
18.6 Chapter 18 Project Organisation

* Note that the word PART: must be written in capitals. The two # will
automatically number the Section with two-digit numbers. Behind
the colon, however, you can enter any desired name, but you must not
leave it without a name. In the given example these tiles/segments are
named PART:01 to PART:04.
) Enter the desired spacing for the grid of receiver points in Grid|Properties. This setting will apply to all tiles.
) Enter the corresponding settings in Calculation|Configuration.
Above all, note the Max. Search Radius in the General tab (see step
3.).
For the calculation start CadnaA in the batch mode Step 3:
(see Chapter 18.7)
After you have created and named all the Sections, save the file in the corresponding IN-directory!!! When you have tiled a file in the described
way, CadnaA will automatically create a second file with the extension
”Part” (e.g. DemoPCSP.cna.part). This file must also be located in the INdirectory. Therefore it is easiest to save the tiled file directly in this directory because CadnaA automatically saves it in the same directory. Now
18.6 Chapter 18 Project Organisation
PCSP - Program Controlled Segmented Processing
Manual
6
18
start CadnaA in the batch mode. (If necessary, refer to the manual or online help - keyword: batch).
CadnaA now recognizes that this file is segmented. The program calculates each tile separately, taking into account not only those objects located
within the tile, but also those objects located within the selected search radius. Then CadnaA saves the calculated grid in the corresponding OUTdirectory . These grid files have the same names as the original files and
are combined with the extension of the Section name but without
"PART":. In our example it would be DemoPCSP.cna.01.cna, DemoPCSP.cna.02.cna a.s.o.
So, if you have several computers in a network or multi-processor computers at your disposal, they can calculate the individual tiles at the same
time. CadnaA automatically organizes the distribution of the tiles to the
computers/processors involved. In this case all the computers involved
have to be started in the batch mode, and all of them have to "observe" the
same IN-directory. When working with a multi-processor computer
CadnaA must be started as many times as there are processors in the computer.
After the calculation fetch your original file and all tiled files from the
OUT-directory, open the original file and load the grids of the tiled files
via Grid|Open. With multiple choice (see help) you can open all the files
at once.

18.7 Batch Operation
It is possible with CadnaA to automatically calculate in succession a grid
or individual receiver points. This is especially interesting for long-term
calculations if you, e.g., want to calculate different variants during the
weekend or over-night.
The following steps are necessary:
To define the calculation that shall be carried out in the batch process, a CNABATCH
text block named CNABATCH has to be created. As an example you may
enter the following commands:
Change Command
starting CadnaA
) On the Windows desktop activate the CadnaA icon by clicking it
once.
) Then select File Properties and insert the following string (including
one blank before it!) in the last line of the command:
/batch=1
CNABATCH
IN and OUT
Create a directory CNABATCH on your hard drive C:. In CNABATCH,
create two sub-directories called IN and OUT.
* Naming the sub-directories IN and OUT is mandatory!!!
CNABATCH is the default directory for the batch feature. If you use this
name, no modification of the Cadnaa.ini file is required. (If you wish to
use a different name, see below.)
The paths then are:
18.7 Chapter 18 Project Organisation
Batch Operation
Manual
2
18
C:\CNABATCH\IN
C.\CNABATCH\OUT
) Copy all those *.CNA files to be processed into the IN directory. It
goes without saying that in each project file the calculation configuration and the immission point grid must be defined appropriately.
Entry in Cadnaa.ini
if necessary
If you do not stick to the default directory name CNABATCH on drive C,
an entry must be made in the file CADNAA.INI residing in the Windows
directory (e.g., ...\WINDOWS (for Windows 3.11/95) or ...\WINNT (for
Windows NT) etc.).
) Open this file using an editor and insert the path where your two
directories IN and OUT are, in the series of commands following the
header [Main]. If, for example, the directory is WEEKEND instead
of CNABATCH, and WEEKEND itself contains in a directory
CADNAA_W, you will have to insert the following line:
BatchDir=C:\CADNAA_W\WEEKEND
) Then save the file and close it.
Launching the
automatic calculation
When CadnaA is launched with the parameter /batch=1 on the expanded
command line, it will check the IN directory for files every 30 seconds. If
any files are found, these will be opened and calculated one by one. The
results will be saved under the same name in the OUT directory, and the
files already calculated are deleted from the IN directory.
Once CadnaA has processed all files, close the program as usual.
CadnaA should not run in the batch mode when project files are edited
rather than calculations carried out because in the batch mode the program
tries to open any files from the IN directory and this may cause problems.
In order to save the trouble of having to delete and re-enter the batch parameters on the command line over and over again, you may wish to create
an additional CadnaA icon on the desktop (e. g. by copying) where the
18.7 Chapter 18 Project Organisation
Batch Operation
Manual
3
18
batch parameter is permanently set. For clarity, the new icon might be
named, e. g., CADNA-BATCH. Use this icon to launch the program when
you wish to carry out several calculations in a series.
This enables a highly professional way of working with CadnaA - particularly if such a „machine“ with a corresponding processor is available in a
network.
In this context also pay attention to the comprehensive facility of PCSP
(Program Controlled Segmented Processing) - (see Chapter 18.6).

Optionen BATCH
Command
With the BATCH command it is possible to execute calculations automatically for grids (noise map) or individual receiver points for several files or
to continue a stopped calculation at the point where it has been stopped.
The selection of the desired mode is controlled by parameters in text
blocks (see Chapter 16.6). If you do not create a textblock a grid is calculated automatically.
To define parameters for calculations in the Batch mode create a local text
block named CNABATCH (pay attention to the capital letters). Enter one
or more of the following commands to execute the corresponding calculation:
Parameter = calculation of
CALC_IMM 1 receiver points (currently displayed variant)
CALC_IMM 2 receiver points (all variants)
CALC_IMM 0 no receiver points (default)
CALC_ RASTER 1 grid (default)
CALC_ RASTER 0 no grid

Several Computers and
the Batch
Command 18.7.0
Access to the same folder/directory through several computers is unambiguously regulated in the Batch mode. If a file is opened, the extension of
this file is renamed from CNA in CNC - another opening of this file is
therefore impossible. After finishing the calculation the extension is again
renamed in CNA and saved in the corresponding OUT directory.
Message after
finishing the
calculation 18.7.0
You can get an electronic message if a calculation is completed by
CadnaA. For that it is required that you have installed a message program
(e.g. WinPopUp) on your computer and that you have created a local text
block named CALC_MESSAGE in your file. In this textblock the computer path or the computer which should get the message must be contained.

CadnaA enables you to calculate air pollution caused by road traffic according to the MLuS 92, Issue 96 /45/. The current issue, which is recommended by, e.g., the Bavarian Government, is integrated and put at your
disposal within the scope of a further update as soon as it is published in a
form applicable for software matters.
Handling in CadnaA is similar to noise calculation according to the method "Long Straight Road " - By clicking on a road in the CadnaA project
with the right mouse key you can select from the opening context menu
the command Air Pollution which will transfer the relevant parameters of
this road automatically to the edit box. Another alternative is opening the
edit box via Tables|Miscellaneous|Air Pollution. In this case you would
have to enter (by keyboard) the relevant parameters like MDTD, Truckpercentage and so on.

20.2 Adjust road to ground height
A terrain model already exists. A road shall be entered or imported. Initial situation
When importing a road, the heights of the road are normally also imported DGM.cna
in a form of absolute heights. In this case we can move to point 6.
If the road shall be inserted on the existing terrain model directly start with
the following point 1.
1. Enter a road with a width of e.g. 4 m - height 0 relative. The heights Procedure
shall be taken from the terrain model. (Example file:

Calculation|Configuration|DTM|Triangulation
2. With the triangulation feature it is not necessary to calculate a grid to
represent the terrain in the 3D-special view. On the other hand the
contour lines must not only be described by their initial and final
points, but also by more points otherwise the terrain will be modeled
too coarsely. (If necessary insert further polygone points either by
input with the mouse cursor or with the function Spline from the context menu.)

20.3 Modeling Multiple Storey Garages
Quick and
effective modeling
of multiple storey garages
In the article „Die Berechnung der Schallemission von Parkhäusern“ (The
calculation of sound emission from multiple storey garages), Zeitschrift
für Lärmbekämpfung Nr. 5/2000 /34/, the general method for the
calculation has been described. In the following we would like to provide a
more detailed explanation of how multiple storey garages (called MSG in
the following) can be modelled quickly and effectively with CadnaA. The
flexibility of the program enables its user to do this in just a few steps.
Task
MSG 70 m x 70 m x 32 m
with 5 storeys of 6 m
height
A MSG with the dimensions 70 m x 70 m x 32 m and with 5 storeys shall
be modelled. The storeys are approximately 6,40 m high, with an opening
one meter in height on all sides of the building. The MSG is assigned to a
large shopping center with goods for daily use. Therefore, many cars come
and go and occupy parking lots (we call that Events). The partial assessment level – distance 35 m and 2 m above ground – is to be determined.
Special for CadnaA User
Brief instruction for the
professional CadnaA
User
) Enter a building with a floor plan equivalent to the floor plan of the
MSG and a height of 0 m.
) Copy this floor plan to a free space, convert it to a Parking Lot and
enter the parameters that describe the events occuring on each storey
of the MSG (Recommendation: no interval max. penalty) – the correct LmE will be shown.
) Convert the Parking Lot to an General Area Source and write
down its sound power level PWL (not PWL’’). Then delete this area
source again.
) The openings around the walls in each storey will be simulated by a

line source in a central position in front of the facade.
) Determine the transmission loss ∆L from the base of the storey -
according to /1/ - the room height and the proportion of openings.
) Generate a line source which surrounds the whole building at the
lowest storey in the form of an object parallel to the floor plan (distance 0.05, height difference corresponding to average height of opening).
) Generate as many copies as there are storeys with the command Duplicate (number of copies which are horizontal: N, vertical: 1, distance
between center points 0), then assign to these line sources the total
sound power PWL + ∆L, K0 = 3 and the correct heights. Do not calculate a reflection at the building.
Done.
Instruction Step by Step
Proceed as is described in the following:
Enter floor plan ) Enter the floor plan of the building with 0/0, 70/0, 70/70 and 0/70.
Activate the icon Building and enter the relevant values via the keyboard
Copy floor plan ) Drag a copy of the floor plan to a free space in the example (select
with mouse click and drag while pressing left mouse key and CTRL
key).
Convert floor plan to
Parking Lot
) Click on the newly formed rectangle with the right mouse key, select
Convert to in the context menu and convert the rectangle to a Parking Lot. Thus you have generated a parking lot with the size of the
storey.

Determine sound power
level of
a line source
Now you determine the sound power level of a line source. According to
the method mentioned in /1/, with respect to table 2 of this article, we get,
for the 1 m high opening in the 6,40 m high storey with the storey base of
70 m x 70 m, a correction of –2.9 dB with a reflecting ceiling, and –9.1 dB
with an absorbent ceiling.
Together with the sound power level of 98.4 dB(A) determined at our Parking Lot source, this will result in a reflection of the storey (with reflecting ceiling) of
PWL = (98.4 – 2.9) dB(A) = 95.5 dB(A)
We recommend entry as shown in the following figure. The uncorrected
value of the sound power level of the storey is entered in normal. A and

Calculation and Optimization
Assessment level and
checking the improvement
after installation
of an absorbent ceiling
The calculation at given receiver points or in the horizontal / vertical grid
is done in the familiar way. By means of this detailed modelling of the individual storeys you can easily check (e.g., in case of critical situations in
the neighbourhood) the improvements that could be achieved either by installation of an absorbent ceiling on individual storeys (in this example the
entry in Attenuation for the relevant line source would change from 2.9 to
9.1), or as a result of smaller openings (determine correction for smaller
proportion of openings from /1/ Table 2 and enter in Attenuation).
Deviant geometries
Forms of floor plans that
are not square
The article this method is based on only deals with square storeys with
openings all around on all sides at a given height. In the case of an irregular form of a floor plan an equivalent square base with the same plane
would be assumed for the determination of the correction ∆L.
Surrounding openings not
on all sides
If the surrounding openings do not run along all sides, the surrounding line
source generated via Parallel Object is adapted by means of Break Lines
and deletion of the non-radiating areas. Due to flat room characteristics,
when reducing the openings by a factor k, the radiated sound intensity will
not increase by the same factor k. Therefore the sound power level can be
reduced by 10 log (k) in this case.
We always appreciate feedback on the applicability of this method.

20.4 The radiation from tunnel openings
One or more roads (or railway tracks) leading into a tunnel will be taken Task
into account in a CadnaA calculation by adopting the sum of the sound
levels at the end of the corresponding road or railway track at the entrance
of the tunnel. Actually a radiation of sound from the tunnel opening occurs, which can cause an increase in the noise level at the residential buildings located near the tunnel opening. In the following it will be shown how
this radiation from tunnel openings can be taken into account with
CadnaA.
We would like to point out that RLS-90 does not take into account the radiation from tunnel openings and therefore does not provide a corresponding calculation method. The procedure described in the following is based
on the deviation in /35/. You must consider that validations of measurement techniques and, if necessary, adaptations are in preparation.

It is assumed that the tunnel has a longitudinal extension that is large compared to its cross-sectional measures b,h and r.
The following quantities are required:
1. Lm,E of all lanes passing through the tunnel as the sum of sound
level.
In the case of one lane this will be directly its Lm,E. In case of two
lanes with Lm,E,1 and Lm,E,2 this value emerges from
This addition of sound level can easily be executed in CadnaA
because the entry fields for the sound power level with point, line and
area sources can be used as a calculator. Example:
We have three roads with the Lm,E - values 65 dB(A), 68 dB(A) and
70 dB(A) running through the tunnel. Enter a point source at an arbitrary location within your project (it will be deleted again afterwards)
and open its edit dialog. Now enter the string 65++68++70 in the
entry field on the right-hand side of the term LwA (++ stands for
addition according to the laws of level addition). In the field next to
the term Result. LwA the value 72.9 will be shown as resulting level.
This is the value for the Lm,E that should be used in the following
when determining the tunnel radiation.

2. The length U of the circumference line of the
tunnel cross-section in meters.
In the case of a rectangular tunnel cross-section with a width b and a

In the second example, shown above, with the arch of a radius r, it
will be .

neither existing nor planned, an absorption coefficient of 0.1 is assumed.
From the averaged absorption coefficient α and the already known
interior length of the circumference U, the absorption length

is calculated and from the following diagram the penalty dL of the
sound level is determined.

4. With this sound level’s penalty dL, the area-related sound power
level LW’’ of the radiating cross-section at the tunnel opening will

The value determined this way takes into account that the entire sound
penetrating from the tunnel is radiated in only one direction. For the modelling of the tunnel opening an absorbent screen is therefore positioned -
from inside to outside - with a vertical area source in front of it. The determined emission value LW’’ as the level of area-related sound power (i.e.
sound power level per m2
 of the area source) is assigned to the latter.
Example A four-lane road with a standard cross-section b2s leads into a tunnel with
a width 15 m and a height 6 m. The sound emission on the outside shall be

20.5 Calculation of the Noise Distribution
Caused by a Magnetic Levitation Train
The noise distribution caused by the railway is calculated according to
SCHALL03 /7/.
The calculation of the noise immision caused by high speed trains is regulated in an individual noise protection guideline /38/ because its characteristic source deviates from the remaining railway noise. The calculation
method according to this regulation is integrated into CadnaA in the noise
calculation of railways according to Schall03. The procedure to transact
the calculation is described shortly in the following.
Deviation of the Usual
Calculation of
Railway Noise 20.5.0
Respecting the technical contents of the „Magnetic Levitation Train“
(Magnetschwebebahn-Lärmschutzverordnung) guideline see the original
paper.
The essential differences from the usual noise calculation of railways according to Schall03 are as follows:
• The Magnetschwebebahn-Lärmschutzverordnung is valid for speeds
up to 500 km/h
• By the emission level a difference is made between the mechanical and
the aerodynamical noise parts. In CadnaA the assessment level results
from both calculated noise parts together.
• Until now for both inserted types of trains, TR 07/1 and TR 07/2, are
the basis values for the train length 150 m and for the speed 400 km/h
• The influence of the vehicle type for the already mentioned noise parts
is for both train types different - it is taken into account automatically
by selecting the vehicle type in CadnaA.
• The two existing types of tracks cause different penalties - these penalties must be inserted manually. The correction is taken into account for
the mechanical noise part only.
• The remaining penalties according to Schall03 are dropped for bridges,
crossings and radia of curves.
20.5 Chapter 20 User’s Guide

• The formulas for propagation differ from the formulas according to
Schall03
• The constructed sections of the component procedure have 1/100 as a
maximum dimension for the distance between receiver points.
• A railway bonus is only taken into account up to 300 km/h.
The two items mentioned last are only valid for the case that the option
Strictly acc. to Schall03/Schall-Transrapid is activated in Calculation|Configuration|Tab Railroad.

If you choose a type of train from the list, the correct penalty of train type
is displayed for the mechanical noise part. Of course, for the calculation,
both penalties are taken into account.
The named differences for the calculation of propagation and the award
for the train bonus are also taken into account by choosing this train type.
* Pay attention: The whole calculation of propagation of the railway
occurs according to Schall Transrapid if the train-class list includes
only one single magnetic levitation train. The decisive factor here is
the expression in the field Type Correction Dfz. (The combination
of different train types onto one magnetic track does not make any
sense in fact).

Land-Use Planning
In this example is the additional CadnaA option BPL used (see Chapter
8.15 "Optimized Area Sources").
With the preparation of plans for using urban land, the use of single areas Prolog
should be tuned so that no conflicts or harmfull environmental effects occur. Noise protection means that the applicable maximum values of noise
relevant partial-areas, like trade or industry areas, must not exeed, the
maximum admissible assesement levels in residential areas.
Noise quota offers a relevant tool for the fulfillment of this task. Thereby,
these areas with planned trade and industrial regions are understood as
area sources with typical emission levels (for these areas) and from them
the resulting assessment levels are calculated.

If the calculation results in an infringement in the residential neighbourhood then the assumed emission levels of the area sources are reduced successively until the calculation can guarantee that the maximum value will
be maintained.
As a result the maximally possible area-related levels of sound power for
the individual partial areas are established and they are textually included
in the determination of the urban land-use plans. If, later on, the admissibility of a concret planned development on a piece of land is to be
checked, then the increase in noise is not allowed to exceed the already established assessment levels at the receiver points in the neighborhood.
For a planning example see the next chapter.

20.6.1 Planning Example
A simple but typical case is showed in the following example.
The settlement of industry is planned for three partial areas. Because of the
intended use for both the upper partial areas, GE 1 and GE 2 would be desirable with an admissible emission level of PWL’’ 65 dB and for GE 3
70 dB. Most of the surrounding residential properties are defined as General Residential Areas with the maximum values of
55 dB(A) day-time and 40 dB(A) night-time.
Only the properties or receiver points I5 and I6 are identified as Mixed Areas with the maximum values of
60 dB(A) day-time and 45 dB(A) night-time.
In the first step with CadnaA you can only check if the maximum value of
the receiver point on the neighborhood’s land is maintained at the required
maximum level of „desired“ emission.
If this is not the case, then, with the next step, it has to be determined
which emissions for the three partial sound levels are possible. Of course,
by that, you should limit, as little as possible, the emission for the partial
areas for which the desired use is critcal in the acoustical sense.

Double-clicking the border of an area opens the above displayed edit dialog. Move this dialog so that the critical receiver points around the planned
industrial area can be watched.
With the scrollbar on the lower edge of this dialog the emission of the corresponding area can be reduced continuously. While reducing the emission
levels the resulting assessment levels on the receiver points are displayed
in „realtime“. It is noticeable that the levels on the receiver points, which
are neighbouring directly on the partial area, change strongly in comparison to the other, more distant receiver points, which change less.
After closing the dialog the same procedure has to be done for the other
partial areas. This successive reduction in the emission for the partial areas
has to be repeated cyclically until all receiver points maintain the valid
values.

20.6.4 Automatic Quota by CadnaA
The program also automatically does these tentative iterative steps for the
maintaining of maximum values by step-by-step reduction of the emission
values. To do this practically, the program must have a strategy with which
it can decide when the emission of a partial area must not be reduced further and thereby, when to reduce the emission of the next partial area.
On this score a usability function has to be applied which takes into account the practical reality as much as possible.
If the allocation of acceptable sound emission over a certain measure, dependent on the intended use, does not make sense, then the emissions of
other partial areas have to be restricted. Such an emission rate is worth
nothing anymore because it cannot be utilized in practice. This defines the
turning point of an emission from a partial area.
The more the emission of this partial area is reduced the more drastic a further reduction for the use of this area is. And the lower the admissible
emission is, the more the usability (per dB) falls. The whole scale is restricted downwards by an emission value and if this value falls below a
certain number then the intended use is no longer possible.
According to this concept each partial area is allocated to a usability curve
which gets still flatter the higher the dB-values are. In the example displayed in the figure the curve runs from 50 dB - this corresponds to the
lowest limit of 0% in usability-value - to the highest limit of 80 dB - this
corresponds to a usability-value of 100%. (This example could be an intended loading yard with intensive traffic in diesel forklifts along with other noisy activities).

This usability function is approached through two lines which are described by the emission value and the usability value at the turning point -
in the above example 60 dB(A) and 80 %.
With the automatic quotation CadnaA checks, with a steady increment of
the total usability of the area, at which partial area the reduction of the
sound power sinks the least. This is continously repeated until the maximum values at the receiver points are maintained.
By this procedure the emission of the partial areas is preferably reduced
by those whose area-related sound power level still lies above the turning
point.

Existing encumbrances can be taken into account easily in this calculation
because, if there are still other existing sources, their contribution is taken
into account for the calculation and, therefore, only the rest, up to the corresponding maximum value is available for the optimisation.

20.6.5 Toward the Determination of Noise Quotas
Noise quotas should be determined if the urban land-use plan is constructed. With that we make sure that the maximum values are not exceeded for
the final development if the area is considered for further usage.
The maximum possible level of area-related sound power for an area is a
„construct“. But with that we can calculate with the following formula the
admissible sound power level (PWL) for any partial area and for any property to be considered separately later
PWL = PWL“ + 10 log(S/S0)
with
S Area of the property in m²
S0 Reference area 1m²
However, also the total sound power level with regard to this property is
an artificial measure. It is therefore always useful to calculate the noise
contribution, caused by this property as a partial area, on the critical points
of the neighborhood and to establish them as check-up criteria.
* Buildings situated in such an Optimizable Area Source are not
taken into account from CadnaA as shielding objects for sound propagation.

20.12.2 Calculation of C0 from Wind Statistics
An often used technic for evaluating the factor C0 is the following calculation method
with
Tm annual part in % of meteorological conditions for downwind and
calm
Km deviation of sound level according to downwind conditions in dB
Tq annual part of crosswind conditions in %
Kq deviation of sound level with crosswind relative to downwind
conditions in dB
Tg annual part of headwind conditions in %
Kg deviation of sound level with headwind relative to downwind
conditions in dB
The determination of Tm, Tq and Tg occurs from the frequency distribution
of the wind direction, which is stated with 12 classes (orientation sectors
with 30 degree each) and one class with calm.
The three groups for wind direction are defined:
Downwind: ±45° in direction of propagation (=90° Sektor) and calm
Crosswind: 45° up to 135° and 225° up to 315° in direction of propagation
Headwind: ±45° against direction of propagation

We recommend that you use the default values for Km, Kq und Kg (except
other values of local authorities are available).
The above wind diagram shows the wind conditions for a city after entering the values of wind statistics. The radius of the dark displayed sectors
are scaled in such way that the largest entered value correspond with the
radius of the limiting circle. Furthermore, a line is drawn in the circle diagram, which represents the directional-dependent value of C0. The outer
circle correspond with the value C0 = 5. The value, represented with a line
in the circle sector, results from a long-term averaging and therefore takes
into account the whole distribution displayed in the wind diagram.
If calculating with these settings then for each sound ray a direction related
C0 is determined which is used in the calculation of attenuation.

How do you import an Ascii file - in our example line1.txt - via the ODBC
interface? The file line1.txt contains only x-y-z-coordinates, the columns
are separated with TAB and the lines with carrige return. The file also has
a column header.
This kind of data could be imported either as one single line or as a lot of
points depending on what it should be. If you want it to be a line then import the file with the function File|Import|File format: AsciiPoly. In the
other case do for practice as described in the following.
) Open a new CadnaA file.
) Click on the menu File|Database|Definition.
) Mark, by clicking on it, the desired CadnaA object type which you
want the importing points to be - like Point Sources, Crossing Lights,
Receiver/Immission Points etc. they are all described only by a x-y-zcoordinate. In our example we chose Point Source.
) Click on the folder icon in the Data Source box - the ODBC Select
Data Source dialog opens. Our Data Source is the folder in which the file line1.txt is saved, not the file itself! You could have more
Ascii files in the same folder.
* In Ascii files the data source is the folder in which the Ascii files are
saved and the files itself are the tables of the database.
) Choose the register Machine Data Source or the corresponding one
depending on the installed ODBC version and on the button New.
A „Machine“ Data Source is specific to your machine/computer and
cannot be shared. A „User“ Data Source is specific to a user on your
computer. A „System“ Data Source can be used by all users connected to e.g. in a network.
) Confirm all dialogs till you come to the driver selecting dialog.
) Select the driver for which you want to set up a Data Source - in our
example „Microsoft Text Driver“.
) Confirm with Next or the corresponding button and define your Data
Source now by entering the Data Source Name and a description.
The Data Source name is mandatory. You will only get access to your
data source/folder by selecting the Data Source name. The name can
be different from the original name.
) If necessary, deactivate the checkbox Use Current Directory and
select the directory in which your data source file line1.txt is saved.
) After confirming with OK click on the Option button in the ODBC
Text Setup dialog, select the extension TXT from the Extension list.
) Press the Define Format button and activate the checkbox Column
Name Header because the file line1.txt contains one (x, y, z).

* If you have an Ascii file with the extension *.CSV the columns are
propably delimited with a comma instead of TABs. We recommend
replacing the comma with TAB and saving the file with the extension
TXT.
Whether a comma separated file works properly or not depends on
your system’s country settings.
